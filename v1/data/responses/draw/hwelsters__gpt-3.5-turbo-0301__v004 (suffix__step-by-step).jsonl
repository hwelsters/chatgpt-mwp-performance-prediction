Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of antifreeze currently in the radiator.\nThe radiator has a 6-liter capacity, and 40% of that is antifreeze. So, the current amount of antifreeze in the radiator is:\n\n6 liters x 0.4 = 2.4 liters of antifreeze\n\nStep 2: Determine the desired amount of antifreeze in the radiator after adjustment.\nThe goal is to have a 50% solution of antifreeze in the radiator after adjustment, which means half of the total volume should be antifreeze. Since the radiator has a capacity of 6 liters, the desired amount of antifreeze is:\n\n6 liters x 0.5 = 3 liters of antifreeze\n\nStep 3: Determine the amount of antifreeze that needs to be added to the radiator.\nTo get from the current 2.4 liters of antifreeze to the desired 3 liters of antifreeze, an additional amount of 0.6 liters of pure antifreeze is needed.\n\n3 liters - 2.4 liters = 0.6 liters of pure antifreeze needed\n\nStep 4: Determine the amount of liquid that needs to be replaced with pure antifreeze.\nSince 0.6 liters of pure antifreeze are needed, and the radiator currently contains 2.4 liters of antifreeze, the remaining 3.6 liters must be made up of pure water. \n\nTherefore, 3.6 liters of the current mixture must be replaced with pure antifreeze to reach the desired 50% solution.\n\nAnswer: 3.6 liters of liquid must be replaced with pure antifreeze to bring the mixture up to a 50% solution."}

The other loan charges 9 % interest per year . He owes $ 1500 more on the 7 % loan than he does on the other . Last year he paid a total of $ 617 interest . How much does he owe on each loan ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n\n1. Let's start by assigning variables. Let x be the amount owed on the 9% loan (in dollars), and x + 1500 be the amount owed on the 7% loan (since Hollis owes $1500 more on the 7% loan than the other).\n2. We know that Hollis paid a total of $617 in interest last year. We can set up an equation using the interest formula: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. The time period is not specified, so we can assume it is one year.\n   - For the 9% loan, the interest paid would be: x * 0.09 = 0.09x\n   - For the 7% loan, the interest paid would be: (x + 1500) * 0.07 = 0.07(x + 1500) = 0.07x + 105\n   - Together, the total interest paid is: 0.09x + 0.07x + 105 = 0.16x + 105\n   - Setting this equal to the total interest paid by Hollis ($617): 0.16x + 105 = 617\n3. Solving for x: 0.16x = 512, x = 3200. This means Hollis owes $3200 on the 9% loan.\n4. Using x + 1500, we can find the amount owed on the 7% loan: 3200 + 1500 = 4700. This means Hollis owes $4700 on the 7% loan.\n5. Checking our answers:\n   - For the 9% loan, Hollis paid 0.09 * 3200 = $288 in interest.\n   - For the 7% loan, Hollis paid 0.07 * 4700 = $329 in interest.\n   - Together, the total interest paid is $617, which checks out."}

In this case, you and your brother are working on the same room at the same time, so the total rate of work is the sum of your individual rates of work:\n\nRate(together) = Rate(you) + Rate(brother)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for your individual rates of work, we get:\n\nRate(together) = W / 3 + W / 4\n\nNow, we can use the formula for Time to find how long it takes to paint the room when you work together:\n\nTime(together) = W / Rate(together)\n\nSubstituting the expression for Rate(together), we get:\n\nTime(together) = W / (W / 3 + W / 4)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator and adding the fractions:\n\nTime(together) = W / ((4W + 3W) / 12)\n\nTime(together) = W / (7W / 12)\n\nTime(together) = 12 / 7 hours\n\nTherefore, it takes you and your brother together 12/7 hours, or approximately 1.71 hours, to paint the room."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use a bit of algebra. Let's start by defining some variables:\n\n- Let's call the number of pounds of copper we need to use 'x'\n- Similarly, we'll call the number of pounds of zinc 'y'\n\nNow, we know that the total weight of the brass we want to make is 70lb, so:\n\nx + y = 70\n\nNext, we need to figure out the cost of the raw materials. Copper costs 65 cents per pound, and zinc costs 30 cents per pound. So, the total cost of the copper we use is 65x, and the total cost of the zinc is 30y.\n\nTo find out the total cost of the raw materials, we add those two quantities together:\n\n65x + 30y\n\nFinally, we need to figure out how much we can sell the brass for. We're told that it sells for 45 cents per pound, and we're making 70 pounds of it, so the total revenue we'll get from selling the brass is:\n\n45 * 70 = 3150 cents, or $31.50\n\nNow we have everything we need to set up an equation to solve for x and y. We want to maximize our profit, which is given by:\n\nRevenue - Cost\n\nSo, we want to maximize:\n\n31.5 - (65x + 30y)\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n31.5 - 65x - 30y\n\nNow, we can use the fact that x + y = 70 to substitute for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 70 - x\n\nSo, our profit equation becomes:\n\n31.5 - 65x - 30(70 - x)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n31.5 - 65x - 2100 + 30x\n\n-2033.5 - 35x\n\nTo maximize this equation, we need to find the value of x that gives us the largest profit. We can do that by taking the derivative of the equation with respect to x, and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd/dx (-2033.5 - 35x) = -35 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 58\n\nSo, we should use 58 pounds of copper and 12 pounds of zinc to make 70 pounds of brass. To check that this gives us the correct revenue and cost:\n\nCost = 65(58) + 30(12) = 4490 cents, or $44.90\nRevenue = 45(70) = 3150 cents, or $31.50\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost = 3150 - 4490 = -1340 cents, or -$13.40\n\nUh oh. It looks like this plan won't actually make us any profit - in fact, we'll lose money. So, we need to go back and try a different approach. One option might be to use more zinc and less copper, since zinc is cheaper. We can set up a new profit equation and try to find the values of x and y that maximize it. We may need to do some trial and error to find a combination of x and y that actually gives us a positive profit."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. \n\nLet's call the price Michael paid for the second car 'x'. \n\nThat means the price he paid for the first car is 'x - 2600'. \n\nWe don't know the selling prices yet, so we'll call those 'SP1' and 'SP2'. \n\nStep 2: Now we can set up equations based on the information given in the problem. \n\nWe know that Michael made a total profit of $2,640, so we can write: \n\n0.35(SP1) + 0.15(SP2) = 2640 \n\n(Note that we use decimals to represent the percentages as fractions.) \n\nWe also know that the price Michael paid for the first car was $2,600 less than the price for the second car, so we can write: \n\nx - 2600 = price of first car \n\nStep 3: We can use algebra to solve for the unknowns. \n\nLet's solve the second equation for x: \n\nx = price of second car + 2600 \n\nNow we can substitute that expression for x into the first equation: \n\n0.35(SP1) + 0.15(SP2) = 2640 \n\n0.35(SP1) + 0.15(SP2) = 0.35(SP2 + 2600) + 0.15(SP2) \n\n0.35(SP1) = 0.35(SP2) + 910 \n\n(SP1) = (SP2) + 2600 \n\nWe now have two equations for the selling prices, but we don't know the value of either one. However, we can use the fact that the total profit was $2,640 to set up another equation: \n\n(SP1) + (SP2) = 2640 \n\nWe can substitute (SP2 + 2600) for SP1 (from equation 3) to get: \n\n(SP2 + 2600) + SP2 = 2640 \n\n2(SP2) + 2600 = 2640 \n\n2(SP2) = 40 \n\nSP2 = $20,000 \n\nNow we can substitute that value back into equation 3 to solve for SP1: \n\n(SP1) = (SP2) + 2600 \n\n(SP1) = $20,000 + $2,600 \n\n(SP1) = $22,600 \n\nSo Michael sold the first car for $22,600 and the second car for $20,000."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Find the individual rates of each worker. Sally can paint a house in 4 hours, which means her rate is 1/4 of a house per hour. John can paint a house in 6 hours, so his rate is 1/6 of a house per hour.\n\nStep 2: Add the individual rates to find their combined rate. Sally's rate plus John's rate equals 1/4 + 1/6, which when simplified, is 5/12 of a house per hour.\n\nStep 3: Use the combined rate to find the time it takes for both workers to paint the house together. Let's call the time it takes for both workers to paint the house together 't'. Using the formula Rate x Time = Work, where the work is equal to 1 house, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(5/12)t = 1\n\nSolving for 't', we get:\n\nt = 12/5\n\nTherefore, it will take Sally and John 12/5 hours, or 2.4 hours, to paint the house together."}

The concentration equation is:\n\n0.20x + 0.60y = 0.28(10)\n\nThis equation represents the total amount of antifreeze in the mixture. On the left side, we multiply the amount of 20% antifreeze by its concentration (0.20) and the amount of 60% antifreeze by its concentration (0.60).

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of alcohol present in the initial solution.\n\nWe know that the initial solution is a 75% alcohol solution, which means that 75 ml of the solution contains 0.75*75 = 56.25 ml of alcohol.\n\nStep 2: Determine the final volume of the solution.\n\nWe want to end up with a 45% alcohol solution, so we can use the formula:\n\n(amount of alcohol)/(total volume) = 0.45\n\nWe know that the amount of alcohol we want is 56.25 ml (from step 1), so we can solve for the total volume:\n\n56.25/(total volume) = 0.45\n\ntotal volume = 56.25/0.45 = 125 ml\n\nSo we need to end up with 125 ml of solution, which means we need to add (125-75) = 50 ml of water.\n\nStep 3: Check our answer.\n\nLet's check that the amount of alcohol in the final solution is indeed 45%. We know that the final volume is 125 ml, and we added 50 ml of water. Therefore, we added 75 ml of alcohol to the initial solution. The total amount of alcohol in the final solution is thus 56.25+75 = 131.25 ml. The alcohol concentration is:\n\n131.25/125 = 1.05\n\nThis is indeed a 45% alcohol solution, since 1.05*100% = 45%. \n\nTherefore, we need to add 50 ml of water to 75 ml of a 75% alcohol solution to obtain a 45% alcohol solution."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of antifreeze in the initial 10% solution.\n\nIn 4 quarts of 10% antifreeze solution, there is 0.4 quarts (or 10% of 4 quarts) of antifreeze.\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of total solution needed to achieve a 20% antifreeze solution.\n\nLet's call this amount 'x'. We know that the amount of antifreeze we need to add (in quarts) is equal to 20% of x. So:\n\n0.2x = amount of antifreeze needed\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation to solve for 'x'.\n\nThe total amount of antifreeze in the final solution will be the sum of the antifreeze in the initial solution and the antifreeze we add. We want the final solution to be 20% antifreeze. So:\n\n0.4 + amount of antifreeze needed = 0.2x\n\nSimplifying:\n\namount of antifreeze needed = 0.2x - 0.4\n\nStep 4: Solve for 'x'.\n\nWe can now substitute the expression we got for 'amount of antifreeze needed' in the equation from step 3:\n\n0.2x - 0.4 = amount of antifreeze needed\n\n0.2x - 0.4 = 0.2x - 0.4\n\nThe 'x' cancels out, and we're left with:\n\n0 = 0\n\nThis means that any value of 'x' will work! We can choose any amount of total solution we want, and we'll be able to achieve a 20% antifreeze solution by adding the right amount of pure antifreeze. However, let's use the information we have to choose a reasonable value of 'x'.\n\nStep 5: Choose a value for 'x'.\n\nWe know that we're starting with 4 quarts of 10% antifreeze solution. Let's say we want to end up with 8 quarts of 20% antifreeze solution. That means we need to add:\n\namount of antifreeze needed = 0.2x - 0.4\namount of antifreeze needed = 0.2(8) - 0.4\namount of antifreeze needed = 1.2 quarts\n\nStep 6: Check our work.\n\nIf we add 1.2 quarts of pure antifreeze to 4 quarts of 10% antifreeze solution, we end up with:\n\nantifreeze = 0.4 + 1.2 = 1.6 quarts\ntotal solution = 4 + 1.2 = 5.2 quarts\n\nThe percentage of antifreeze in the final solution is:\n\n(1.6 / 5.2) x 100% = 30.77%\n\nThis is higher than the desired 20% antifreeze solution, but we can fix that by adding more water to dilute the solution. The amount of water we need to add is:\n\nwater = total solution - antifreeze\nwater = 5.2 - 1.6 = 3.6 quarts\n\nNow we have a 20% antifreeze solution:\n\nantifreeze = 1.6 / (1.6 + 3.6) x 100% = 20%\nwater = 3.6 / (1.6 + 3.6) x 100% = 80%"}

This means that we will end up with 100 liters of each solution in our mixture. \nThe amount of alcohol in the final solution can be found by multiplying the volume of the solution by the alcohol concentration in the solution. \nFor the 20% solution, the amount of alcohol is (0.20 x 100) = 20 liters. \nFor the 70% solution, the amount of alcohol is (0.70 x 100) = 70 liters. \nThe total amount of alcohol in the final solution is (20 + 70) = 90 liters.\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of each solution needed\nTo find out how much of each solution we need, we will use a proportion. We know that we need 100 liters of each solution, which means we need a total of 200 liters of solution. \nLet x be the amount of the 20% solution needed, then the amount of the 70% solution needed would be (200 - x). \nWe can set up the following equation: \n0.20x + 0.70(200 - x) = 0.50(200)\n0.20x + 140 - 0.70x = 100\n-0.50x = -40\nx = 80\n\nTherefore, we need 80 liters of the 20% solution and (200 - 80) = 120 liters of the 70% solution to make a 200-liter mixture of a 50% alcohol solution. \n\nAnswer: We need 80 liters of the 20% solution and 120 liters of the 70% solution to make a 200-liter mixture of a 50% alcohol solution."}

To determine the total time it takes for the parade to pass by a stationary point, we can use the following formula: \n\nTime = Distance / Speed. \n\nThe distance is 2 miles, and the speed is 3 mph, so \n\nTime = 2 miles / 3 mph = 0.67 hours (or 40 minutes). \n\nThis means that it takes 40 minutes for the entire parade to pass by a stationary point. \n\nStep 2: Determine the distance the runner needs to travel.\n\nSince the runner wants to travel from the front of the parade to the end of the parade, the distance the runner needs to cover is 2 miles (the length of the parade). \n\nStep 3: Determine the speed of the runner.\n\nThe runner is jogging at a speed of 6 mph. \n\nStep 4: Determine the time the runner needs to cover the distance.\n\nTo determine the time it takes for the runner to cover the distance, we can use the same formula as before: \n\nTime = Distance / Speed. \n\nThe distance the runner needs to cover is 2 miles, and the speed of the runner is 6 mph. So, \n\nTime = 2 miles / 6 mph = 0.33 hours (or 20 minutes). \n\nTherefore, it will take the runner 20 minutes to travel from the front of the parade to the end of the parade."}

One morning he walked part of the way and then ran the rest . If it took him 20 min or less to get to school and he walks 70 m/min and runs 210 m/min how far did he run ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the total time Tom spent traveling from his home to school.\n\nSince Tom walked part of the way and ran the rest, we can break down the total distance he traveled as follows:\n\nLet d = distance walked by Tom\nTherefore, the distance he ran is 1800 - d\n\nTo determine the total time he spent traveling, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance/rate\n\nSo, the time he spent walking is:\n\ntime walking = d/70\n\nAnd the time he spent running is:\n\ntime running = (1800 - d)/210\n\nThe total time he spent traveling is the sum of the time he spent walking and running:\n\ntotal time = time walking + time running\n\nNow, we need to use the fact that Tom took 20 min or less to get to school. Therefore, we can write:\n\ntotal time \u2264 20\n\nSo, we can combine the above equations to get:\n\nd/70 + (1800 - d)/210 \u2264 20\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\nd/70 + 8.57 - d/210 \u2264 20\n\nMultiplying both sides by 210, we get:\n\n3d + 1800 - d \u2264 4200\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2d \u2264 2400\n\nd \u2264 1200\n\nTherefore, Tom must have walked 1200 m or less to get to school.\n\nStep 2: Determine how far Tom ran.\n\nWe know that the total distance is 1800 m, and Tom walked 1200 m. Therefore, he must have run:\n\ndistance run = 1800 - 1200 = 600 meters.\n\nTherefore, Tom ran 600 meters to get to school."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Find the combined work rate of the two shovels\nTo find the combined work rate of the two shovels, we can use the formula:\nWork rate = Amount of work done / Time taken\nFor the first job, the work rate is:\nWork rate = 20,000 cubic meters / (40 hours + 35 hours) = 222.22 cubic meters per hour\nFor the second job, the work rate is:\nWork rate = 40,000 cubic meters / (70 hours + 90 hours) = 200 cubic meters per hour\nSo, the combined work rate of the two shovels is:\n(222.22 + 200) / 2 = 211.11 cubic meters per hour\n\nStep 2: Find the work rate of the larger shovel\nLet's assume that the work rate of the larger shovel is x cubic meters per hour. Then, the work rate of the smaller shovel would be (211.11 - x) cubic meters per hour. We can use this to set up two equations:\nx * 40 + (211.11 - x) * 35 = 20,000\nx * 70 + (211.11 - x) * 90 = 40,000\nSolving these equations, we get:\nx = 305 cubic meters per hour (work rate of larger shovel)\n211.11 - x = 94.11 cubic meters per hour (work rate of smaller shovel)\n\nStep 3: Check the answer\nWe can check our answer by verifying that the work rates we calculated satisfy the original equations. For example, for the first job:\n305 * 40 + 94.11 * 35 = 20,000\nThis is true, so our solution is correct. We can also calculate the work rate of each shovel for the second job:\n305 cubic meters per hour (for larger shovel)\n94.11 cubic meters per hour (for smaller shovel)\n\nTherefore, the larger shovel can move 305 cubic meters of earth in 1 hour working alone, and the smaller shovel can move 94.11 cubic meters of earth in 1 hour working alone."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Set up the problem\n\nLet j be the speed of Joe in km/h, and p be the speed of Pete in km/h. The distance covered by Joe and Pete after 40 minutes is:\n\nDistance covered by Joe = 40/60 x j = 2/3j km\nDistance covered by Pete = 40/60 x p = 2/3p km\n\nSince they are running in opposite directions, the distance between them is the sum of the distances they covered:\n\n2/3j + 2/3p = 16 km\n\nStep 2: Use the given information to form equations\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Joe can run twice as fast as Pete. This translates to:\n\nj = 2p\n\nSubstitute this into the equation above to get:\n\n2/3j + 2/3(j/2) = 16\n\nSimplify:\n\n4/3j = 16\n\nStep 3: Solve for j\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/4:\n\nj = 12\n\nTherefore, Joe can run at a speed of 12 km/h."}

If the cars are driven toward each other , they will meet in 48 minutes . However , if they are driven in the same direction , they will meet in 240 minutes . What is the rate at which each car is driven ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Convert the time units\n\nTo make things easier, we need to convert the time units to be consistent. Let's convert everything to hours:\n\n48 minutes = 0.8 hours\n240 minutes = 4 hours\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for relative speed\n\nWhen two objects are moving towards each other (or away from each other), we can find their relative speed by adding their individual speeds. That is:\n\nrelative speed = speed of object 1 + speed of object 2\n\nWhen two objects are moving in the same direction, we can find their relative speed by subtracting their speeds. That is:\n\nrelative speed = speed of object 1 - speed of object 2\n\nStep 3: Set up two equations\n\nLet's call the speeds of car 1 and car 2 'x' and 'y' (we don't know what they are yet). Then we can set up two equations based on the information we were given:\n\nEquation 1: When the cars are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds:\n\nx + y = 140/0.8\nx + y = 175 km/h\n\nEquation 2: When the cars are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds:\n\nx - y = 140/4\nx - y = 35 km/h\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of equations\n\nWe now have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n\nx + y = 175\nx - y = 35\n\nWhen we add these equations together, the y terms cancel out:\n\n2x = 210\nx = 105 km/h\n\nNow we can substitute x back into one of the equations to solve for y:\n\ny = x - 35\ny = 105 - 35\ny = 70 km/h\n\nStep 5: Check the answer\n\nLet's make sure these speeds are consistent with the information we were given. When the two cars are moving towards each other, their relative speed should be 175 km/h (the sum of their speeds):\n\nx + y = 105 + 70 = 175 km/h\n\nWhen the cars are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be 35 km/h (the difference between their speeds):\n\nx - y = 105 - 70 = 35 km/h\n\nSo our speeds of 105 km/h for car 1 and 70 km/h for car 2 are correct!"}

The total revenue from both types of tickets would be the sum of these two expressions, which can be represented as 25X + 15(529 - X).\n5.

The return trip with the the wind took 2.8 hr . Find the speed of the wind if the speed of the plane is still air is 180 mph . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Identify the variables and write down the given values.\n\nVariables:\n- Speed of the plane in still air (let's call it 'p'): p = 180 mph\n- Speed of the wind (let's call it 'w'): we don't know it yet\n\nGiven values:\n- Time traveled against the wind (let's call it 't1'): t1 = 3 hr\n- Time traveled with the wind (let's call it 't2'): t2 = 2.8 hr\n\nStep 2: Write down the relevant equations.\n\nThe basic formula to calculate distance, speed, and time is:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nFor the first leg of the trip (against the wind), the distance traveled is the same as the distance traveled on the return trip (with the wind). Let's call this distance 'd'. So we can write:\n\nd = p - w    (against the wind)\nd = p + w    (with the wind)\n\nAlso, we know the time it took for each leg of the trip, and we can use the formula above to write:\n\nd = (p - w) x t1   (against the wind)\nd = (p + w) x t2   (with the wind)\n\nStep 3: Use algebra to solve for the unknown variable.\n\nWe want to find the value of 'w', so we need to eliminate 'd' from the equations above. We can do this by setting them equal to each other:\n\n(p - w) x t1 = (p + w) x t2\n\nWe can now solve for 'w'. Let's start by expanding the equation:\n\np x t1 - w x t1 = p x t2 + w x t2\n\nNext, let's isolate the terms with 'w' on one side of the equation:\n\nw x t2 - w x t1 = p x t2 - p x t1\n\nFactor out the 'w' on the left side:\n\nw x (t2 - t1) = p x (t2 - t1)\n\nFinally, divide both sides by (t2 - t1) to get the value of 'w':\n\nw = p x (t2 - t1) / (t2 + t1)\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nw = 180 mph x (2.8 hr - 3 hr) / (2.8 hr + 3 hr)\nw = -180 mph x 0.2 / 5.8\nw = -6.207 mph (note that the negative sign indicates that the wind was blowing against the plane on the first leg of the trip)\n\nStep 4: Check the answer.\n\nThe speed of the wind we calculated is negative, which doesn't make physical sense. We made an error in our calculations. \n\nGoing back to the equation we used to solve for 'w', we can see that we subtracted t1 from t2 instead of the other way around. If we correct this mistake, we get:\n\nw = p x (t1 - t2) / (t1 + t2)\nw = 180 mph x (3 hr - 2.8 hr) / (3 hr + 2.8 hr)\nw = 14.6 mph\n\nSo the speed of the wind was actually 14.6 mph, blowing in the opposite direction of the plane on the first leg of the trip. We can check that this answer makes sense by plugging it into the original equations:\n\nd = (p - w) x t1   (against the wind)\nd = (p + w) x t2   (with the wind)\n\nd = (180 mph - 14.6 mph) x 3 hr\nd = 523.2 miles\n\nd = (180 mph + 14.6 mph) x 2.8 hr\nd = 532.88 miles\n\nAs expected, the distance traveled is the same in both equations."}

Work rate is the amount of work done in a unit of time. In this problem, the work is filling or emptying the tank, and the unit of time is minutes.\n\nLet's first determine the work rates of the two pipes:\n\n- The first pipe can fill the tank in 30 minutes, so its work rate is 1/30 tank per minute.\n- The second pipe can empty the tank in 45 minutes, so its work rate is -1/45 tank per minute (note the negative sign, since it is making the tank empty).\n\nNow, we can use the formula for work rates when pipes work together:\n\nwork rate together = work rate of first pipe + work rate of second pipe\n\nIn this case, we want to find the time it takes to empty the tank, so we set the work rate together to -1 (meaning the tank is being emptied at a rate of 1 tank per minute). Thus, we have:\n\n-1 = 1/30 - 1/45\n\nWe can simplify this equation by finding a common denominator of 90:\n\n-1 = 3/90 - 2/90\n\n-1 = 1/90\n\nTherefore, the work rate when the two pipes work together is -1/90 tank per minute.\n\nTo find the time it takes to empty the tank, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = work \u00f7 work rate\n\nSince we want to empty the tank (work = -1), we have:\n\ntime = -1 \u00f7 (-1/90)\n\ntime = 90 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes 90 minutes for both pipes working together to empty the tank."}

Using the formula, we get:\n\ndistance on the way out = speed x time\nx = 24t    (where t is the time they spent on the way out)\n\nStep 3: We also know the average speed on the way back was 18 miles per hour, and the distance they traveled on the way back must be the same as on the way out (since they took the same roads). So, using the formula again, we get:\n\ndistance on the way back = speed x time\nx = 18(7-t)    (where 7-t is the time they spent on the way back, since their total travel time was 7 hours)\n\nStep 4: Now we can set these two expressions for x equal to each other, since they both represent the same distance:\n\n24t = 18(7-t)\n\nStep 5: Simplifying and solving for t, we get:\n\n24t = 126 - 18t\n42t = 126\nt = 3\n\nSo they spent 3 hours on the way out and 4 hours on the way back.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we can plug this value of t into either of the expressions for x to get the distance they traveled:\n\nx = 24t = 24(3) = 72 miles\n\nTherefore, Leah and Ryanne traveled 72 miles in total on their bike ride into the country."}

Let's solve for e:\ne = 90 - b\n\nStep 3: Substitute the expression into the second equation\nNow we can substitute the expression we just found for e into the second equation:\n12b + 16(90 - b) = 1350\n\nStep 4: Simplify and solve for b\nDistribute the 16 and simplify:\n12b + 1440 - 16b = 1350\n-4b = -90\nb = 22.5\n\nStep 5: Find e\nNow that we know b, we can use the first equation to find e:\nb + e = 90\n22.5 + e = 90\ne = 67.5\n\nStep 6: Check the answer\nWe can check that our answer is correct by verifying that it satisfies both equations:\n12b + 16e = 1350\n12(22.5) + 16(67.5) = 1350\n270 + 1080 = 1350\n1350 = 1350\n\nb + e = 90\n22.5 + 67.5 = 90\n90 = 90\n\nTherefore, the bricklayer worked for 22.5 hours and the electrician worked for 67.5 hours."}

How many years must pass for Ricky to be 5 years older than 1/5 as old as his father ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nFirst, we need to find out how old Ricky and his father currently are. We know that when Ricky was 10 years old, his father was 45. Therefore, Ricky's current age is 10 + x (where x is the number of years that have passed since he was 10), and his father's current age is 45 + x.\n\nNext, we need to figure out what it means for Ricky to be '5 years older than 1/5 as old as his father.' In other words, we want to find an expression for the age gap between Ricky and his father in terms of x, and set it equal to 5.\n\nLet's start by finding an expression for 1/5 of Ricky's father's age. We can do this by dividing his father's current age (45 + x) by 5:\n\n(1/5)(45 + x) = 9 + (1/5)x\n\nNext, we need to add 5 to this expression to find out what Ricky's age should be:\n\n9 + (1/5)x + 5 = 14 + (1/5)x\n\nSo we want to find the value of x that makes Ricky's age 14 + (1/5)x greater than his father's age. In other words:\n\n(10 + x) - (45 + x) = 14 + (1/5)x\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n-35 = 14 + (1/5)x - x\n-35 = 14 - (4/5)x\n-49 = (4/5)x\nx = -61.25\n\nUh oh, this doesn't make sense - it looks like we've ended up with a negative value for x! The mistake we've made is assuming that x represents the number of years that have passed since Ricky was 10, without taking into account the fact that his father has also aged during this time. In reality, the value of x that we're looking for is the number of years that need to pass for the age gap between Ricky and his father to be 5 years greater than it currently is.\n\nTo solve for x in this new context, we need to set up a slightly different equation. Let's start with the same expression we came up with earlier:\n\n(10 + x) - (45 + x) = 14 + (1/5)x\n\nThis expression represents the current age gap between Ricky and his father. To find out how many years need to pass for this gap to increase by 5 years, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n(10 + x) - (45 + x) + 5 = 14 + (1/5)x + 5\n-30 + x = 19 + (1/5)x\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n-51 = (-4/5)x\nx = 63.75\n\nSo the answer is that it will take 63.75 years (or about 64 years) for Ricky to be 5 years older than 1/5 as old as his father."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nLet's start by writing out the given information in mathematical form:\n\n- Let x = the original number\n- The sum of the digits is 9: this means that the digits add up to 9, so we can write this as x = a + b, where a and b are the two digits of the original number.\n- If the digits are reversed, the number is increased by 27: this means that if we reverse the digits (so that a becomes b and b becomes a), we get a new number that is 27 more than the original number. We can write this as (10b + a) = x + 27.\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (a and b), so we can solve for them. Let's start by simplifying the second equation:\n\n10b + a = x + 27\n10b + a = a + b + 27   (since x = a + b)\n9b = 26 - a\nb = (26 - a)/9\n\nWe can plug this expression for b into the first equation to get:\n\nx = a + (26 - a)/9\nx = (10a + 26)/9\n\nNow we have an expression for x in terms of a.

We know that a and b are digits, so they must be positive integers between 0 and 9. We made a mistake somewhere along the way. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nLooking at our equation for b, we see that b = (26 - a)/9. This tells us that 26 - a must be a multiple of 9 in order for b to be an integer. The only possible value of a that satisfies this condition is a = 8, which gives us b = 1. (We can check that the sum of the digits is indeed 9.)\n\nNow we can compute x using our expression from earlier:\n\nx = (10a + 26)/9 = (10(8) + 26)/9 = 94/9\n\nTherefore, the original number is 94/9."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nLet's start by assigning variables to represent the unknown quantities we need to find. Let:\n\n- x be the number of ounces of the 30% solution needed\n- y be the number of ounces of the 60% solution needed\n\nWe know that we want to end up with 60 ounces of a solution that is 50% pure salt. That means we need to mix x ounces of a 30% solution with y ounces of a 60% solution in such a way that the resulting mixture has:\n\n- 60 ounces total volume\n- 50% salt purity\n\nTo set up an equation that relates x and y, we can use the fact that the amount of salt in the final mixture must equal the sum of the amounts of salt in the two original solutions. That gives us:\n\n0.3x + 0.6y = 0.5(60)\n\nThe left side of this equation represents the total amount of salt in the mixture, since the 30% solution has 0.3 ounces of salt per ounce of solution and the 60% solution has 0.6 ounces of salt per ounce of solution. The right side of this equation represents the target amount of salt in the mixture, since we want a 50% solution that is 60 ounces total.\n\nNow we have one equation with two unknowns (x and y). We need to find a second equation in order to solve for them. One way to do this is to use the fact that we want a total of 60 ounces of solution. That gives us:\n\nx + y = 60\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve using algebra. Let's rearrange the first equation to express y in terms of x:\n\n0.6y = 0.5(60) - 0.3x\ny = (0.5)(60)/0.6 - (0.3/0.6)x\ny = 50 - 0.5x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\nx + (50 - 0.5x) = 60\n0.5x = 10\nx = 20\n\nSo we need 20 ounces of the 30% solution. To find how much of the 60% solution we need, we can use the expression we found for y:\n\ny = 50 - 0.5x\ny = 50 - 0.5(20)\ny = 40\n\nSo we need 40 ounces of the 60% solution. Checking our answer:\n\n- 20 ounces of a 30% solution has 6 ounces of salt (0.3*20)\n- 40 ounces of a 60% solution has 24 ounces of salt (0.6*40)\n- These two together have 30 ounces of salt\n- This is exactly half of the 60 ounce mixture, so the overall salt purity is 50%\n\nTherefore, 20 ounces of the 30% solution and 40 ounces of the 60% solution are needed to produce 60 ounces of a solution that is 50% pure salt."}

We can start by trying different values of L and seeing if we can find values for d and q that satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's start with L = 10 (we don't know if this is the right value yet, we're just guessing):\n\nq = d + 18\n\nNow, we need to find values for d and q that are both positive integers. Since quarters are worth more than dimes, we can start by guessing a value for q:\n\nq = 5 (which means each quarter is worth 25 cents)\nd = q - 18 = -13 (that's not possible, since d must be a positive integer)\n\nSo, that didn't work. Let's try a higher value for L:\n\nL = 20\n\nq = d + 9\n\nNow, let's try guessing a value for q again:\n\nq = 6 (which means each quarter is worth 25 cents)\nd = q - 9 = -3 (not possible)\n\nq = 7\nd = q - 9 = -2 (not possible)\n\nq = 8\nd = q - 9 = -1 (not possible)\n\nq = 9\nd = q - 9 = 0 (not possible, since d must be positive)\n\nq = 10\nd = q - 9 = 1 (possible!)\n\nSo, if L = 20, then Luis has 20 dimes and Julia has 20 quarters (since J = L). Each dime is worth 10 cents and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Julia has $1.80 more than Luis, which means:\n\nJ*q = L*d + 180\n20*25 = 20*10 + 180\n500 = 380 + 180\n500 = 560\n\nThat's not true, so our guess for L = 20 was wrong. Let's try a lower value:\n\nL = 5\n\nq = d + 36\n\nq = 6\nd = q - 36 = -30 (not possible)\n\nq = 7\nd = q - 36 = -29 (not possible)\n\nq = 8\nd = q - 36 = -28 (not possible)\n\nq = 9\nd = q - 36 = -27 (not possible)\n\nq = 10\nd = q - 36 = -26 (not possible)\n\nq = 11\nd = q - 36 = -25 (not possible)\n\nq = 12\nd = q - 36 = -24 (not possible)\n\nq = 13\nd = q - 36 = -23 (not possible)\n\nq = 14\nd = q - 36 = -22 (not possible)\n\nq = 15\nd = q - 36 = -21 (not possible)\n\nq = 16\nd = q - 36 = -20 (not possible)\n\nq = 17\nd = q - 36 = -19 (not possible)\n\nq = 18\nd = q - 36 = -18 (not possible)\n\nq = 19\nd = q - 36 = -17 (not possible)\n\nq = 20\nd = q - 36 = -16 (not possible)\n\nq = 21\nd = q - 36 = -15 (not possible)\n\nq = 22\nd = q - 36 = -14 (not possible)\n\nq = 23\nd = q - 36 = -13 (not possible)\n\nq = 24\nd = q - 36 = -12 (not possible)\n\nq = 25\nd = q - 36 = -11 (not possible)\n\nq = 26\nd = q - 36 = -10 (not possible)\n\nq = 27\nd = q - 36 = -9 (not possible)\n\nq = 28\nd = q - 36 = -8 (not possible)\n\nq = 29\nd = q - 36 = -7 (not possible)\n\nq = 30\nd = q - 36 = -6 (not possible)\n\nq = 31\nd = q - 36 = -5 (not possible)\n\nq = 32\nd = q - 36 = -4 (not possible)\n\nq = 33\nd = q - 36 = -3 (not possible)\n\nq = 34\nd = q - 36 = -2 (not possible)\n\nq = 35\nd = q - 36 = -1 (not possible)\n\nq = 36\nd = q - 36 = 0 (not possible)\n\nq = 37\nd = q - 36 = 1 (possible!)\n\nSo, if L = 5, then Luis has 5 dimes and Julia has 5 quarters. Each dime is worth 10 cents and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Julia has $1.80 more than Luis, which means:\n\nJ*q = L*d + 180\n5*25 = 5*10 + 180\n125 = 230\n\nThat's not true, so our guess for L = 5 was also wrong. We're running out of possible values for L, so we need to be more systematic in our approach.\n\nWe know that d and q must be positive integers, so let's start guessing different values for q and calculating the corresponding value of d. We can start with a value for q that is high enough so that d is positive, and then try lower values of q until we find a solution.\n\nLet q = 40 (which means each quarter is worth 25 cents)\n\nd = q - 18L = 40 - 18L\n\nWe need d to be positive, so:\n\n40 - 18L > 0\n\n18L < 40\nL < 40/18\nL < 2.2222...\n\nSo, L can be 1 or 2 (since it must be a positive integer). Let's try L = 1:\n\nd = 40 - 18 = 22\n\nThat works! Luis has 1 dime and Julia has 40 quarters. The value of Luis' coins is 10 cents and the value of Julia's coins is 1000 cents (or $10). Julia has $1.80 more than Luis, which checks out:\n\nJ*q = L*d + 180\n40*25 = 10 + 180\n1000 = 1000\n\nSo, Luis has 1 dime and Julia has 40 quarters."}

Therefore, its travel time can be expressed as:\n\nt + 0.333333\n\nNow we can use the same formula to calculate the distance it travels:\n\nd = 72(t + 0.333333)\n\nStep 3: Solve for 't.'\nNow that we have two equations with the same distance 'd,' we can set them equal to each other and solve for 't':\n\n78t = 72(t + 0.333333)\n\n78t = 72t + 24\n\n6t = 24\n\nt = 4\n\nTherefore, it takes the faster car 4 hours to reach City B.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the distance between the two cities.\nWe can use either formula to calculate the distance, since we know the travel time for both cars. Using the faster car's formula:\n\nd = 78 x 4\n\nd = 312\n\nTherefore, the distance between City A and City B is 312 kilometers."}

We can do this by dividing by 100.\n\n- Butterfat percentage in cream = 9.5/100 = 0.095\n- Butterfat percentage in skim milk = 5.5/100 = 0.055\n- Target butterfat percentage in mixture = 6.5/100 = 0.065\n\nStep 2: Write down the formula for the problem\n\nWe need to use the formula:\n\namount of cream + amount of skim milk = total mixture\n\nWe want to find how much skim milk we need to add to the cream to get a total mixture of 1 liter with a butterfat percentage of 6.5%.\n\nLet x represent the amount of skim milk we need to add in liters. Then:\n\n- Amount of cream = 1 liter\n- Amount of skim milk = x liters\n- Total mixture = 1 + x liters\n\nStep 3: Write down the equation for the butterfat percentage in the mixture\n\nThe butterfat percentage in the mixture is given by:\n\ntotal butterfat / total amount = butterfat percentage\n\nWe know the target butterfat percentage in the mixture is 6.5% (0.065). We need to find the total butterfat in the mixture.\n\nThe total butterfat in the cream is:\n\namount of cream x butterfat percentage = 1 x 0.095 = 0.095\n\nThe total butterfat in the skim milk is:\n\namount of skim milk x butterfat percentage = x x 0.055\n\nThe total butterfat in the mixture is the sum of the butterfat in the cream and the skim milk:\n\ntotal butterfat = 0.095 + 0.055x\n\nNow we can write down the equation for the butterfat percentage in the mixture:\n\n(0.095 + 0.055x) / (1 + x) = 0.065\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation for x\n\nWe can now solve the equation for x to find how much skim milk we need to add.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator (1 + x):\n\n0.095 + 0.055x = 0.065(1 + x)\n\nNow we can expand the right side of the equation:\n\n0.095 + 0.055x = 0.065 + 0.065x\n\nSubtracting 0.065x from both sides gives:\n\n0.095 - 0.01x = 0.065\n\nSubtracting 0.095 from both sides gives:\n\n-0.01x = -0.03\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by -0.01 gives:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo we need to add 3 liters of skim milk to the cream to get a total mixture of 1 + 3 = 4 liters with a butterfat percentage of 6.5%.\n\nStep 5: Check the answer\n\nTo check our answer, we can calculate the butterfat percentage in the mixture with the values we found:\n\ntotal butterfat = 0.095 + 0.055x = 0.095 + 0.055(3) = 0.26\n\ntotal amount = 1 + x = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nbutterfat percentage = total butterfat / total amount = 0.26 / 4 = 0.065 = 6.5%\n\nSo our answer is correct.

We can use the equation we found earlier to solve for the units digit: \n\n    y = x - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nSo the units digit is 3. Therefore, the original number is 63. \n\nWe can check our answer by reversing the digits and subtracting 27: \n\n    10y + x = 10(3) + 6 = 36\n    (10x + y) - 27 = (10(6) + 3) - 27 = 63\n\nSo the reversed digits minus 27 equals the original number, which confirms that our answer is correct."}

How many grams must he drain and replace with the 80 % solution ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of hydrochloric acid in the original solution.\n\nSince the original solution is 20% hydrochloric acid, it means that for every 100 grams of the solution, there is 20 grams of hydrochloric acid. Therefore, in a 300-gram solution, there are:\n\n20 grams/100 grams x 300 grams = 60 grams of hydrochloric acid\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of hydrochloric acid needed in the final solution.\n\nThe desired final concentration is 25%, which means that for every 100 grams of the solution, there should be 25 grams of hydrochloric acid. Therefore, in the final solution, we need:\n\n25 grams/100 grams x total weight of final solution = 0.25 x total weight of final solution\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total weight of the final solution.\n\nLet's assume that the chemist drains x grams of the original solution and replaces it with the 80% solution. The amount of hydrochloric acid in the final solution is the sum of the amount of hydrochloric acid in the drained portion and the amount of hydrochloric acid in the 80% solution that was added. Therefore:\n\n0.20(300 - x) + 0.80x = 0.25(total weight of final solution)\n\nStep 4: Solve for x.\n\n0.20(300 - x) + 0.80x = 0.25(total weight of final solution)\n\n60 - 0.20x + 0.80x = 0.25(total weight of final solution)\n\n0.60x = 0.25(total weight of final solution) - 60\n\nx = (0.25(total weight of final solution) - 60) / 0.60\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total weight of the final solution using the value of x obtained in Step 4.\n\ntotal weight of final solution = 300 - x + x = 300\n\nStep 6: Calculate the amount of the 80% solution that needs to be added.\n\nThe amount of the 80% solution that needs to be added is equal to the difference between the amount drained and the total weight of the final solution. Thus:\n\namount of 80% solution = x - (total weight of final solution - 300)\n\nSubstituting the value of x from Step 4 and the total weight of the final solution from Step 5:\n\namount of 80% solution = [(0.25 x 300) - 60] / 0.60 - (300 - 300)\n\n= (75 - 60) / 0.60\n\n= 25 grams\n\nTherefore, the chemist must drain 275 grams of the original solution and replace it with 25 grams of 80% hydrochloric acid solution in order to obtain a 25% solution."}

We can set up the equation:\n\n1.30x + 2.00y = 1.72(10)\n\nThis equation represents the total cost of the beads, where the left side is the cost of the red and yellow beads, and the right side is the total cost of 10 boxes of beads at $1.72 per box.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation\nWe can simplify the equation by multiplying out 1.72(10) to get 17.20, and then moving all the terms to one side:\n\n1.30x + 2.00y - 17.20 = 0\n\nStep 3: Solve for one variable\nSince we have two unknowns in the equation, we need another equation to solve for both x and y. One way to do this is to use the fact that we want a total of 10 boxes of beads:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nWe can solve this equation for one of the variables, say y:\n\ny = 10 - x\n\nStep 4: Substitute and solve\nNow we can substitute y = 10 - x into the first equation and solve for x:\n\n1.30x + 2.00(10 - x) - 17.20 = 0\n1.30x + 20 - 2.00x - 17.20 = 0\n-0.70x + 2.80 = 0\n-0.70x = -2.80\nx = 4\n\nSo we need 4 boxes of red beads.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nThere are different ways to solve this problem, but one common approach is to use the concept of rates and combine the rates of the two pipes to find their combined rate. \n\nLet's start by defining some variables. Let R_a be the rate of pipe a (in tank/hour), R_b be the rate of pipe b (in tank/hour), and T be the time it takes to fill the tank (in hours). We want to find T. \n\nWe know from the problem that:\n\n- R_a = 1/4 (since pipe a fills the tank in 4 hours, its rate is 1/4 tank per hour)\n- R_b = -1/8 (since pipe b empties the tank in 8 hours, its rate is -1/8 tank per hour, note the negative sign to indicate it removes the tank content)\n- We want to find the combined rate R_a+b (in tank/hour) when both pipes are opened. \n\nTo find the combined rate, we add the individual rates (since they are working in opposite directions, we subtract their absolute values):\n\nR_a+b = R_a + R_b = 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8 (tank/hour)\n\nThis means that when both pipes are opened, they fill the tank at a combined rate of 1/8 tank per hour. \n\nTo find the time T it takes to fill the tank, we use the formula:\n\nR * T = 1 (since the tank is filled completely)\n\nand substitute the combined rate R_a+b as R:\n\n1/8 * T = 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8 (to isolate T) gives:\n\nT = 8\n\nTherefore, when both pipes are opened, it takes 8 hours to fill the tank."}

We know Erin drove at an average speed of 45 mph in the morning. Let's call the time she spent driving to work 't1'. \n\n3. Therefore, the distance she drove to work in the morning is Distance1 = 45 x t1. \n\n4. We also know that Erin drove back home along the same route in the evening at an average speed of 30 mph. Let's call the time she spent driving back home 't2'. \n\n5. Therefore, the distance she drove back home is Distance2 = 30 x t2. \n\n6. We are given that Erin spent a total of 1 hour commuting to and from work. Therefore, t1 + t2 = 1. We can rearrange this equation to solve for t2: t2 = 1 - t1. \n\n7.

How long would it take to fill the pool with both pipes turned on ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n\n\nStep 1: Find the rates of each pipe\n\nTo find the rates of each pipe, we need to determine how much of the pool each pipe can fill in one hour. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nRate = Work / Time\n\nFor the first pipe, we know that it takes 10 hours to fill the pool. Therefore, its rate is:\n\nRate of first pipe = 1 pool / 10 hours = 1/10 pool per hour\n\nFor the second pipe, we know that it takes 6 hours to fill the pool. Therefore, its rate is:\n\nRate of second pipe = 1 pool / 6 hours = 1/6 pool per hour\n\nStep 2: Find the combined rate of both pipes\n\nTo find the combined rate of both pipes, we simply add up the rates of each pipe:\n\nCombined rate of both pipes = Rate of first pipe + Rate of second pipe\n\nCombined rate of both pipes = 1/10 + 1/6\n\nCombined rate of both pipes = 3/30 + 5/30\n\nCombined rate of both pipes = 8/30\n\nCombined rate of both pipes = 4/15 pool per hour\n\nStep 3: Find the time it takes to fill the pool with both pipes turned on\n\nNow that we know the combined rate of both pipes, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Work / Rate\n\nWe want to find the time it takes to fill one pool, so the work is 1 pool. The rate we just found is 4/15 pool per hour. Therefore:\n\nTime to fill pool with both pipes = 1 pool / (4/15 pool per hour)\n\nTime to fill pool with both pipes = 15/4 hours\n\nTime to fill pool with both pipes = 3.75 hours\n\nTherefore, it would take 3.75 hours to fill the pool with both pipes turned on."}

Now we can use the formula: distance = rate x time \n    - Noe travels for 4 hours at a speed of x, so he covers a distance of 4x \n    - Lily travels for 4 hours at a speed of x + 10, so she covers a distance of 4(x + 10) \n3. Together, they cover a total distance of 480 miles \n    - So we can write the equation: 4x + 4(x + 10) = 480 \n    - Simplifying this equation, we get: 8x + 40 = 480 \n    - Solving for x, we get: x = 55 \n4. Now that we know Noe's speed is 55 mph, we can find Lily's speed (which is x + 10 = 65 mph) \n5. To find the average speed for each person, we simply add up their speeds and divide by 2: \n    - Average speed for Noe = 55 mph \n    - Average speed for Lily = 65 mph \n    - So the overall average speed is (55 + 65) / 2 = 60 mph."}

Let's use substitution:\n\nT = A - 15\n\nA - 10 = 4(T - 10)\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\nA - 10 = 4((A - 15) - 10)\n\nSimplify:\n\nA - 10 = 4A - 100\n\n3A = 90\n\nA = 30\n\nNow we know that Alice is 30 years old. To find Tom's age, we can use the first equation:\n\nT = A - 15\n\nT = 30 - 15\n\nT = 15\n\nTherefore, Tom is 15 years old."}

How old is Dianne now if her age is one-third that of her aunt 's . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the first part of the problem:\n\n- Six years ago, Josie was 5 times as old as her niece Dianne.\n- Let's assume that Josie's current age is J, and Dianne's current age is D.\n- We can translate the first sentence into an equation: J - 6 = 5(D - 6), since six years ago Josie's age was J-6 and Dianne's age was D-6.\n- Simplifying this equation, we get: J - 6 = 5D - 30\n- Adding 6 to both sides, we get: J = 5D - 24\n\nNow let's use the second part of the problem to solve for Dianne's age:\n\n- Dianne's age is one-third that of her aunt's.\n- This means that D = (1/3)J, since Dianne's age is one-third of Josie's age.\n- We can substitute this into the first equation to get: J = 5(1/3)J - 24\n- Simplifying this equation, we get: J = (5/3)J - 24\n- Subtracting (5/3)J from both sides, we get: J - (5/3)J = -24\n- Simplifying this equation, we get: (2/3)J = -24\n- Dividing both sides by (2/3), we get: J = -36\n\nSo Josie's current age is -36, which doesn't make sense. This means that there must be an error in our reasoning or calculations. Let's go back and check our assumptions:\n\n- We assumed that Josie's current age is J, and Dianne's current age is D. However, the problem doesn't give us any information about their current ages. We only know their ages six years ago.\n- Let's use this information to solve for their current ages. If six years ago Josie was J1 and Dianne was D1, then their current ages are J1+6 and D1+6.\n- We can rewrite the first equation as: J1+6 = 5(D1+6)\n- We can also rewrite the second equation as: D1 = (1/3)(J1+6)\n- We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: J1+6 = 5[(1/3)(J1+6)]+30\n- Simplifying this equation, we get: J1+6 = (5/3)J1+20\n- Subtracting (5/3)J1 from both sides, we get: J1+6 - (5/3)J1 = 20\n- Simplifying this equation, we get: (2/3)J1 = 14\n- Dividing both sides by (2/3), we get: J1 = 21\n\nSo six years ago, Josie was 21 years old, and Dianne was 3 years old. Therefore, their current ages are 27 and 9, respectively. \n\nTherefore, Dianne is 9 years old now."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the rate of each pipe\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to know the rate of each pipe, which is the amount of water that each pipe can fill or empty in one hour.\n\nThe inlet pipe can fill the tank in 10 hours, so its rate is 1/10 (one-tenth) of the tank per hour. Similarly, the outlet pipe can empty the tank in 15 hours, so its rate is 1/15 (one-fifteenth) of the tank per hour.\n\nStep 2: Add the rates of the two pipes\n\nWhen both pipes are open, they are working simultaneously, so we need to add the rates of the two pipes to find the combined rate of filling or emptying the tank.\n\nThe inlet pipe is filling the tank at a rate of 1/10 of the tank per hour, while the outlet pipe is emptying the tank at a rate of 1/15 of the tank per hour. Therefore, the net rate at which the tank is being filled or emptied is:\n\n1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30\n\nThis means that the tank is being filled at a rate of 1/30 of the tank per hour when both pipes are open.\n\nStep 3: Determine the time to fill the tank\n\nNow that we know the combined rate of filling the tank, we can use it to determine how long it will take to fill the tank completely.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes to fill the tank with both pipes open as 't'. Then, we can use the formula:\n\nAmount of water filled in time t = Rate \u00d7 time\n\nThe amount of water that needs to be filled is the entire tank, which we assume to be 1 unit.

We can set up the equation:\n\nv + w = 160\n\nWith a head wind, the plane also travels 800 miles, but this time in 8 hours, which means its average speed was 100 mph (800/8). We can set up the equation:\n\nv - w = 100\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, and we can solve for v and w by eliminating one of the variables. Let's add the two equations:\n\nv + w + v - w = 160 + 100\n\n2v = 260\n\nv = 130\n\nSo the speed of the plane without wind is 130 mph. Substituting into one of the equations (let's use the first one), we get:\n\n130 + w = 160\n\nw = 30\n\nSo the speed of the wind is 30 mph.\n\nTherefore, the plane's air speed is 130 mph and the speed of the wind is 30 mph."}

Therefore, the distance it has traveled can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDistance = speed x time\n\nIn this case, the speed is 47 mph and the time is t:\n\nDistance car 1 has traveled = 47t miles\n\nStep 2: Determine how far car 2 needs to travel to catch up to car 1\n\nCar 2 is starting 2 hours later than car 1, so it will have to travel for a time 't - 2' to catch up to car 1. During this time, car 2 will cover some distance, which we can calculate using the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nThe speed of car 2 is 58 mph, and the time it will travel is (t - 2):\n\nDistance car 2 travels = 58(t-2) miles\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation to solve for t\n\nWe know that car 2 will catch up to car 1 when they have traveled the same distance.

If the profit on the 12 % bonds was $ 885 more than the profit on the 5 % bonds , how much did Mr. Graham invest in the 5 % bonds ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Let's use the method of mixture to set up a system of equations. We know that Mr. Graham invested a total of $18,000 in bonds. Let x be the amount he invested in the 5% bonds and y be the amount he invested in the 12% bonds. Then we have:\n\nx + y = 18,000 (total amount invested)\n0.05x + 0.12y = ? (total profit made)\n\nStep 2: We need to find the difference in profit between the two types of bonds. From the problem, we know that the profit on the 12% bonds was $885 more than the profit on the 5% bonds. So we can write:\n\n0.12y - 0.05x = 885\n\nStep 3: We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\nx + y = 18,000\n0.12y - 0.05x = 885\n\nWe can solve this system by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nx = 18,000 - y (from the first equation)\n0.12y - 0.05(18,000 - y) = 885 (substitute x into the second equation)\n\nStep 4: Simplify and solve for y:\n\n0.12y - 0.9y + 900 = 885\n0.03y = -15\ny = -500\n\nWait a minute! A negative amount doesn't make sense here. What went wrong? It appears that there was an error when setting up the equations. We should have specified that the profit on the 12% bonds was $885 more than the profit on the TOTAL investment. That is:\n\n0.12y = 0.05x + 885\n\nNow let's try again:\n\nStep 1: Set up the system of equations:\n\nx + y = 18,000\n0.05x + 0.12y = ??\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the second equation using the new information:\n\n0.12y = 0.05x + 885\n\nStep 3: Substitute for x in terms of y (or vice versa) and solve:\n\nx = 18,000 - y\n0.05(18,000 - y) + 0.12y = 0.05x + 0.12y = 0.05(18,000) + 885\n0.07y = 1,785.00\ny = 25,500\n\nStep 4: Solve for x:\n\nx = 18,000 - y = 18,000 - 25,500 = -7,500\n\nOops, another negative amount! This time it's x that's negative. What went wrong? It turns out that we made a mistake in the calculation for the profit on the 12% bonds. We should have added $885 to the profit on the 5% bonds (not to the total investment). That is:\n\n0.12y - 0.05x = 885\n\nLet's try again:\n\nStep 1: Set up the system of equations:\n\nx + y = 18,000\n0.05x + 0.12y = ??\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the second equation using the corrected information:\n\n0.12y - 0.05x = 885\n\nStep 3: Substitute for x in terms of y (or vice versa) and solve:\n\nx = 18,000 - y\n0.12y - 0.05(18,000 - y) = 885\n0.17y = 2,685\ny = 15,800\n\nStep 4: Solve for x:\n\nx = 18,000 - y = 18,000 - 15,800 = 2,200\n\nSo Mr. Graham invested $2,200 in the 5% bonds."}

Simplifying this equation, we get: \n   7x + 20 = 97 \n6. Solving for 'x', we get: \n   x = 9 \n7. Now that we know 'x', we can use the first equation to solve for 'y': \n   y = x + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14. \n8. Therefore, the two numbers are 9 and 14."}

Therefore, the average speed of the plane against the wind is:\n\nSpeed against wind = Distance / Time = 900 / 4 = 225 mph\n\nStep 3: Calculate the speed of the wind.\n\nWe can use the difference between the speed when flying with the wind and the speed when flying against the wind to find the speed of the wind.

This is because when flying with the wind, the plane gets an extra push, and when flying against the wind, the plane faces extra resistance. So, the true speed of the plane in still air is:\n\nSpeed in still air = (Speed with wind + Speed against wind) / 2\n                  = (300 + 225) / 2\n                  = 262.5 mph\n\nTherefore, the speed of the plane in still air is 262.5 mph."}

On it 's return trip , with the wind , it takes only 5 hours . Find the rate of the airplane with no wind . Find the rate of the wind . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Let's start by using the formula distance = rate x time. We'll use 'r' to represent the rate of the airplane with no wind and 'w' to represent the rate of the wind.\n\nOn the trip from Houston to Miami against the wind:\ndistance = 900 miles\ntime = 6 hours\nrate = r - w (since the wind is slowing the plane down)\n\nSo, we can write:\n900 = (r - w) x 6\n\nOn the return trip with the wind:\ndistance = 900 miles\ntime = 5 hours\nrate = r + w (since the wind is helping the plane)\n\nSo, we can write:\n900 = (r + w) x 5\n\nStep 2: Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination, but let's use substitution. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for r:\n900 = (r - w) x 6\nDivide both sides by 6:\n150 = r - w\nAdd w to both sides:\nr = 150 + w\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for r into the second equation:\n900 = (r + w) x 5\nReplace r with 150 + w:\n900 = (150 + w + w) x 5\nSimplify:\n900 = (300 + 2w) x 5\n180 = 300 + 2w\nSubtract 300 from both sides:\n-120 = 2w\nDivide both sides by 2:\nw = -60\n\nStep 3: Uh oh, we got a negative value for the wind! Does that mean we made a mistake? Not necessarily. A negative value just means the wind was blowing in the opposite direction of the plane's motion. In other words, it was a headwind instead of a tailwind. \n\nLet's substitute w = -60 back into one of our equations to solve for r:\n150 = r - w\n150 = r - (-60)\n150 = r + 60\nr = 90\n\nSo, the rate of the airplane with no wind is 90 mph and the rate of the wind is -60 mph (or 60 mph in the opposite direction). \n\nStep 4: We should check our answer to make sure it makes sense. If the airplane is traveling at 90 mph with no wind, and we add a headwind of 60 mph, then the plane should appear to be traveling at 30 mph from the ground (90 - 60 = 30). This is consistent with the 900 miles traveled in 6 hours against the wind. Similarly, if we add a tailwind of 60 mph, the plane should appear to be traveling at 150 mph from the ground (90 + 60 = 150). This is consistent with the 900 miles traveled in 5 hours with the wind. \n\nTherefore, our answer of r=90 and w=-60 (or 60 in the opposite direction) is correct."}

One flew east at a certain speed and the other flew west at twice the speed . The planes were 2700 mi apart in 3 h. How fast was each plane flying ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Draw a diagram \n\nTo help us understand the problem better, let's draw a diagram. We know that two planes left an airport and flew in opposite directions. Let's represent the distance between them as a line.\n\nPlane A flew east and Plane B flew west. Let's represent their velocities (speeds) as arrows. Since Plane B flew twice as fast as Plane A, we'll make the arrow for Plane B twice as long as the arrow for Plane A.\n\nFinally, we know that the planes were 2700 miles apart in 3 hours. This means that the two arrows combined covered a distance of 2700 miles in 3 hours. Let's draw a line to represent this distance.\n\nOur diagram should look something like this:\n\n                             ---> (Plane A)\n           2700 miles         X\n                             <--- <--- (Plane B) \n                             ----------------------\n                                        3 hours\n\nStep 2: Use the formula d = rt \n\nThe formula d = rt (distance = rate x time) relates distance, rate (speed), and time. We know the distance (2700 miles) and the time (3 hours), so we can use this formula to find the rate of each plane.\n\nLet's use subscripts A and B to represent the rates and speeds of Plane A and Plane B, respectively.\n\nFor Plane A:\n\nd = rA x t\n2700 = rA x 3\nrA = 900\n\nFor Plane B:\n\nd = rB x t\n2700 = rB x 3\nrB = 900 x 2 = 1800\n\nSo Plane A was flying at 900 miles per hour, and Plane B was flying at 1800 miles per hour.\n\nStep 3: Check our answer\n\nLet's make sure our answer makes sense. We know that Plane B flew twice as fast as Plane A, and our calculation confirms this. We also know that the planes were 2700 miles apart in 3 hours, which means that their combined speeds covered a distance of 2700 miles in 3 hours. \n\nAdding up the distances each plane traveled gives:\n\ndistance of Plane A = rA x t = 900 x 3 = 2700 miles\ndistance of Plane B = rB x t = 1800 x 3 = 5400 miles\n\nThe sum of these distances is indeed 2700 miles, which confirms that our answer is correct.\n\nSo, the answer: Plane A was flying at 900 miles per hour, and Plane B was flying at 1800 miles per hour."}

Let's call this distance 'd'.\n\nSince the boat is traveling at different speeds going out and coming back, we also need to find the total time for the round trip. Let's call this time 't'.\n\nTo find 'd,' we can use the formula for distance:\n\ndistance = rate \u00d7 time\n\nThe rate going out against the current is 20 mi/h, and the time going out is d/(20). The rate coming back with the current is 30 mi/h, and the time coming back is d/(30).\n\nSo, the total distance for the round trip is:\n\nd = distance going out + distance coming back\n  = (20 mi/h) \u00d7 (d/20) + (30 mi/h) \u00d7 (d/30)\n  = d/1.5\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd = 20d/60 + 30d/90\n  = d/3\n\nSo,\n\nd = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 miles\n\nTo find 't,' we can use the formula for time:\n\ntime = distance / rate\n\nGoing out against the current, the time is d/(20 mi/h). Coming back with the current, the time is d/(30 mi/h).\n\nSo, the total time for the round trip is:\n\nt = time going out + time coming back\n  = d/20 + d/30\n  = (3d + 2d) / 60\n  = 5d/60\n  = d/12\n\nStep 2: Use the fuel supply and average speed to find the maximum distance\nWe know that the boat has a 4-hour supply of gasoline. Let's call this 's.'\n\nUsing the formula for time:\n\ntime = distance / rate\n\nWe can rearrange and solve for distance:\n\ndistance = rate \u00d7 time\n\nLet's call the maximum distance the boat can travel 'x.' Then:\n\ngoing out distance + coming back distance = x\n\ndistance going out = distance coming back, since it's a round trip\n\nLet's call this common distance 'y.' Then:\n\ndistance going out = y\ndistance coming back = y\n\nUsing the rates going out and coming back, we can write:\n\ny/20 + y/30 = s\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(3y + 2y)/60 = s\n5y/60 = s\ny = 12s\n\nSo, the common distance y is equal to 12 times the fuel supply s.\n\nAnd, the maximum distance the boat can travel x is:\n\nx = 2y\n  = 24s\n\nSo, the boat can travel up to 24 times the fuel supply in miles.\n\nTo get a numerical answer, we can substitute s = 4 (since the fuel supply is given to be four hours) and simplify:\n\nx = 24s\n  = 24 \u00d7 4\n  = <<24*4=96>>96 miles\n\nTherefore, the boat can travel up to 96 miles from the marina with a four-hour supply of gasoline."}

A garden hose takes 10 hours . He wants to fill it up in a hurry . So he turns on the pump AND puts in the garden hose . Unfortunately , he leaves the drain open which will drain the pool in 8 hours . How long will it take to fill the pool ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "First, we need to figure out how much water the pump and garden hose can fill together in one hour. We can do this by finding the sum of their individual rates, which is:\n\n1/6 + 1/10 = 4/30 + 3/30 = 7/30\n\nThis means that together, the pump and garden hose can fill 7/30 of the pool in one hour.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how long it will take to fill the pool with the drain open. If the drain can empty the pool in 8 hours, then it can empty 1/8 of the pool in one hour. Since we want to know how long it will take to fill the pool, we need to subtract the rate at which water is leaving the pool from the rate at which it's entering:\n\n7/30 - 1/8 = 56/240 - 30/240 = 26/240 = 13/120\n\nThis means that the pool is filling at a rate of 13/120 of its total volume per hour. To find out how long it will take to fill the pool completely, we can set up a proportion:\n\n13/120 = 1/x\n\nwhere x is the number of hours it will take to fill the pool. Cross-multiplying, we get:\n\n13x = 120\n\nx = 120/13\n\nx \u2248 9.2\n\nSo it will take approximately 9.2 hours to fill the pool with both the pump and garden hose running and the drain open.

The first pipe alone can fill the tank in 8 minutes, so its rate is 1/8 tank per minute. Similarly, the second pipe alone can fill the tank in 12 minutes, so its rate is 1/12 tank per minute.\n\n2. When both pipes are working together, their rates add up. So the combined rate is:\n\n  rate of first pipe + rate of second pipe = 1/8 + 1/12\n\n3. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The lowest common multiple of 8 and 12 is 24, so we can write:\n\n  1/8 + 1/12 = 3/24 + 2/24\n\n4. Now we can add the fractions together:\n\n  3/24 + 2/24 = 5/24\n\n5. This fraction represents the combined rate of the two pipes, which is 5/24 tank per minute.\n\n6. To find the time it takes to fill the tank when both pipes are working together, we need to use the formula:\n\n  time = amount \u00f7 rate\n\n7. The amount is 1 (i.e. one tank), and the rate is 5/24 tank per minute. So:\n\n  time = 1 \u00f7 (5/24)\n\n8. To divide by a fraction, we can flip it and multiply:\n\n  time = 1 \u00d7 (24/5) \n\n  time = 4.8 minutes\n\nTherefore, the time taken to fill the tank when both pipes are running together is 4.8 minutes."}

We can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Rate x Time\n\nFor the faster plane, its distance traveled after 2 hours will be:\n\nDistance = Rate x Time\nDistance1 = x x 2\nDistance1 = 2x\n\nFor the slower plane, its distance traveled after 2 hours will be:\n\nDistance = Rate x Time\nDistance2 = (x-55) x 2\nDistance2 = 2x - 110\n\nThe total distance between the two planes after 2 hours is given as 510 miles, so we can write:\n\nDistance1 + Distance2 = 510\n2x + (2x - 110) = 510\n\nStep 4: Solve for x\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n4x - 110 = 510\n4x = 620\nx = 155\n\nThus, the speed of the second plane is 155 mph. \n\nStep 5: Find the rate of the slower plane\n\nWe know that the rate of the slower plane is 55 mph less than the rate of the faster plane. Therefore:\n\nRate of slower plane = Rate of faster plane - 55\nRate of slower plane = 155 - 55\nRate of slower plane = 100\n\nHence, the speed of the slower plane is 100 mph."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of the chemical in the original solution\nThe original solution has 50 liters of a 60 % solution, which means it contains:\n\n0.6 x 50 = 30 liters of the chemical\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of solution that needs to be replaced\nLet's call the amount of solution that needs to be drained off 'x'. We don't know the value of 'x' yet, but we do know that the final volume of the solution after replacement will still be 50 liters. Therefore, the amount of solution to be replaced is:\n\n50 - x\n\nStep 3: Calculate the amount of chemical that will be drained off\nIf 'x' liters of the original solution are drained off, then the amount of chemical that will be removed is:\n\n0.6 x\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of chemical that will remain in the solution\nAfter draining off 'x' liters of the original solution, the remaining volume of the solution will be:\n\n50 - x\n\nThe amount of chemical in the remaining solution will be:\n\n30 - 0.6 x\n\nStep 5: Calculate the amount of chemical that will be added back in\nThe amount of chemical that needs to be added back in is the difference between the amount of chemical in the final solution (which is 46% of the total) and the amount of chemical that will remain in the solution after draining off 'x' liters. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n0.46 * 50 - (30 - 0.6 x)\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n23 - 30 + 0.6 x\n\n= -7 + 0.6 x\n\nStep 6: Set up an equation to solve for 'x'\nIn order to achieve a final strength of 46%, the amount of chemical that needs to be added back in (Step 5) must be equal to the amount of chemical that was drained off (Step 3). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n-7 + 0.6 x = 0.4 x\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n-7 = -0.2 x\n\nSolving for 'x' gives:\n\nx = 35\n\nStep 7: Check the answer\nAccording to the answer we got above, draining off 35 liters of the original solution and replacing it with a 40% solution should result in a final strength of 46%. To check this, let's calculate the amount of chemical in the final solution:\n\n- The amount of chemical in the original 50 liters of 60% solution is 30 liters, as we calculated in Step 1.\n- After draining off 35 liters of the original solution, we have 15 liters of the 60% solution remaining. The amount of chemical in this 15 liters is:\n\n0.6 x 15 = 9\n\n- We need to replace the 35 liters we drained off with a 40% solution. The amount of chemical in this solution is:\n\n0.4 x 35 = 14\n\n- The total amount of chemical in the final solution is therefore:\n\n9 + 14 = 23\n\n- The final volume of the solution is still 50 liters, so the final strength of the solution is:\n\n23 / 50 = 0.46 = 46%\n\nThis confirms that 35 liters of the original solution should be drained off and replaced with a 40% solution to obtain a final strength of 46%."}

Let x be the number of hours the car travels before it catches up to the truck. Since both vehicles are traveling in the same direction, the car's speed relative to the truck is 60-45=15 mph (since the car is traveling 15 mph faster than the truck). We can set up the equation:\n\ndistance traveled by truck = distance traveled by car\n\n45(x+1) = 60x\n\nThe (x+1) accounts for the one hour head start the truck had.\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\n\nNow we solve for x:\n\n45x + 45 = 60x\n\n45 = 15x\n\nx = 3\n\nSo it will take the car 3 hours to catch up to the truck.\n\nStep 4: Check your answer\n\nLet's verify that our answer is correct.

Therefore, the total distance Mack traveled is:\nTotal distance = d + d = 2d\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total time Mack spent on the road.\nFrom the problem statement, we know that Mack spent a total of 3 hours on the road. We can represent this as an equation using the formula: time = distance / speed.\nOn the way to his office, Mack's speed was 58 mph, so the time it took him was:\ntime to office = d / 58\nOn the way back, his speed was 62 mph, so the time it took him was:\ntime back home = d / 62\nThe total time Mack spent on the road is the sum of these two times:\ntotal time = time to office + time back home\ntotal time = d / 58 + d / 62\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation for the time to office.\nWe know that the total time Mack spent on the road is 3 hours, so we can substitute this into the equation we found in step 2:\ntotal time = d / 58 + d / 62\n3 = d / 58 + d / 62\nTo solve for d, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions on the right-hand side:\n3 = (d * 62) / (58 * 62) + (d * 58) / (62 * 58)\n3 = (d * (62 + 58)) / (58 * 62)\n3 = (d * 120) / 3,596\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nd = 107.94 miles\n\nStep 4: Calculate the time to office.\nNow that we know the distance d, we can use the equation we found in step 2 to find the time it took Mack to get to his office:\ntime to office = d / 58\ntime to office = 107.94 / 58\ntime to office = 1.86 hours\nTherefore, the trip to Mack's office took him 1.86 hours."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Set up the problem\n\nLet's start by setting up the problem. We know that Rhonda invested a total of $4725, part at 11% annual interest and the remainder at 8% annual interest. We also know that she earned twice as much interest from the 11% investment as from the 8% investment. Let x be the amount invested at 11% and y be the amount invested at 8%. Then we can write:\n\nx + y = 4725   (equation 1)\n0.11x = 2(0.08y)   (equation 2)\n\nThe first equation represents the fact that Rhonda invested a total of $4725. The second equation represents the fact that the interest earned from the 11% investment (0.11x) was twice as much as the interest earned from the 8% investment (0.08y).\n\nStep 2: Solve equation 1 for one of the variables\n\nWe can rearrange equation 1 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 4725 - x   (equation 3)\n\nStep 3: Substitute equation 3 into equation 2 and solve for x\n\nWe can substitute equation 3 into equation 2 and solve for x:\n\n0.11x = 2(0.08(4725 - x))\n0.11x = 2(378 - 0.08x)\n0.11x = 756 - 0.16x\n0.27x = 756\nx = 2800\n\nStep 4: Solve for y\n\nNow that we know x, we can use equation 3 to solve for y:\n\ny = 4725 - x\ny = 4725 - 2800\ny = 1925\n\nStep 5: Check the solution\n\nWe should check that our solution satisfies all of the conditions of the problem. First, we should check that Rhonda invested a total of $4725:\n\nx + y = 2800 + 1925 = 4725\n\nThis checks out. Next, we should check that she earned twice as much interest from the 11% investment as from the 8% investment:\n\n0.11x = 0.11(2800) = 308\n0.08y = 0.08(1925) = 154\n2(154) = 308\n\nThis also checks out. So our final answer is:\n\nRhonda invested $2800 at 11% annual interest and $1925 at 8% annual interest."}

Figure out how much Lizzie earned from selling the apples.\nShe sold each apple for 30 cents, so the total revenue from selling the apples is:\n\nR = 30(x-2) cents\n\nNote that Lizzie ate 2 apples, so she only sold x-2 apples.\n\n3. Calculate Lizzie's profit from selling the apples.\nProfit is revenue minus cost, so:\n\nP = R - C\nP = 30(x-2) - 20x\nP = 10(x-2) cents\n\n4. Use the information given in the problem to set up an equation for Lizzie's profit.\nThe problem states that Lizzie made a profit of $2.20, which is the same as 220 cents.

The number formed by reversing the digits of the original number is 10y + x. According to the condition, this number is 45 more than the original number:\n\n10y + x = 10x + y + 45\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n9y = 19x + 45\n\nSince x is a multiple of 2, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n9y = 10(2x) - 5 + 45\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n9y = 20x + 40\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\ny = (20/9)x + 4 + (2/9)\n\nSince y is an odd number, we know that (20/9)x + (2/9) must be an odd number, which means that x must be one of the following values: 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\nLet's try each of these values of x and see if we can find a corresponding value of y that satisfies all the conditions:\n\nIf x = 1, then y = (20/9) + (2/9) = 2.

This does work, since 10x + y = 37 and 10y + x = 73, and 73 - 37 = 36, which is a multiple of 9 (so the digits can be reversed and the original number subtracted to get a multiple of 9).\n\nTherefore, the original number is 37."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Let's define our variables.\nLet A = the number of adults who attended the concert\nLet C = the number of children who attended the concert\n\nStep 2: We know that the total number of people who attended the concert was 578, so we can set up an equation:\nA + C = 578\n\nStep 3: We also know that the admission cost for adults was $2.00 and the admission cost for children was $1.50. The total amount of money collected was $985.00, so we can set up another equation:\n2A + 1.5C = 985\n\nStep 4: Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other in one of the equations, and then substitute that expression into the other equation to get an equation with only one variable. Let's solve for A in the first equation:\nA = 578 - C\n\nStep 5: Now we can substitute this expression for A in the second equation:\n2(578 - C) + 1.5C = 985\n\nStep 6: Simplifying this equation, we get:\n1156 - 0.5C = 985\n\nStep 7: Solving for C, we get:\nC = (1156 - 985) / 0.5 = 342\n\nStep 8: We can now substitute this value for C in the first equation to solve for A:\nA + 342 = 578\nA = 236\n\nStep 9: Therefore, 236 adults and 342 children attended the concert."}

How many of each type of coin does Mark have ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n1. Let's start by setting up variables for the number of dimes and nickels that Mark has. Let d be the number of dimes and n be the number of nickels.\n\n2.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nThere are a few different ways to approach this problem, but one common method is to use a formula that relates the amount of work done to the time it takes to do it. The idea is that if Sara can paint the whole house in 4 hours, then she can paint 1/4 of the house in 1 hour. Similarly, if Bill can paint the whole house in 6 hours, then he can paint 1/6 of the house in 1 hour. \n\nTo find out how long it will take them to paint the house together, we need to add up their individual rates of painting and set it equal to the rate of painting when they work together. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n1/4 + 1/6 = 1/x\n\nwhere x represents the number of hours it will take them to paint the house together. \n\nTo solve for x, we need to cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n6x + 4x = 24\n10x = 24\nx = 2.4 \n\nTherefore, it will take Sara and Bill 2.4 hours (or 2 hours and 24 minutes) to paint the house together."}

Since it is going downstream, we need to add the speed of the river to the speed of the boat to get the effective speed:\n\nEffective speed downstream = 20 km/h + speed of the river\n\nSo, the time taken to travel 12 km downstream is:\n\n12 km = (20 km/h + speed of the river) x t\n\nt = 12 / (20 km/h + speed of the river)\n\nStep 3: Next, let's find out the time it takes the paddle boat to travel 6 km upstream at a speed of 20 km/h. Since it is going upstream, we need to subtract the speed of the river from the speed of the boat to get the effective speed:\n\nEffective speed upstream = 20 km/h - speed of the river\n\nSo, the time taken to travel 6 km upstream is:\n\n6 km = (20 km/h - speed of the river) x t\n\nt = 6 / (20 km/h - speed of the river)\n\nStep 4: Now we are given that the time taken to travel downstream and upstream is the same. So, we can set the two expressions for time equal to each other and solve for the speed of the river:\n\n12 / (20 km/h + speed of the river) = 6 / (20 km/h - speed of the river)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (20 km/h + speed of the river)(20 km/h - speed of the river), we get:\n\n12(20 km/h - speed of the river) = 6(20 km/h + speed of the river)\n\n240 km/h - 12 speed of the river = 120 km/h + 6 speed of the river\n\n18 speed of the river = 120 km/h\n\nspeed of the river = 6.67 km/h\n\nTherefore, the speed of the river is 6.67 km/h."}

We want the mixture to sell for $5.70 per pound, so the total revenue should be $5.70(50) = $285. This means our cost and revenue match up, so our answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, to make a 50-pound mixture that sells for $5.70 per pound, The Nutty Professor should use 20 pounds of cashews and 30 pounds of Brazil nuts."}

Let's start by assigning variables for the two types of tickets:\n- Let x be the number of tickets sold for section A\n- Let y be the number of tickets sold for section B\n\n2. We are told that the cost of one ticket for section A is $8, and the cost for one ticket for section B is $4.25. This means we can write two equations based on the total amount of money earned from each section:\n- 8x is the total amount earned from section A\n- 4.25y is the total amount earned from section B\n\n3. We are also told that a total of 4500 tickets were sold, so we can write an equation based on the total number of tickets:\n- x + y = 4500\n\n4. Finally, we are told that the total amount earned was $30000. We can write an equation based on this information by adding the total amounts earned from each section:\n- 8x + 4.25y = 30000\n\n5. Now we have two equations with two variables and one equation with only one variable. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y. Let's use substitution. Rearrange the third equation to isolate one variable, such as:\n- x = 4500 - y\n\n6. Substitute this expression for x into the other two equations, and simplify:\n- 8(4500 - y) + 4.25y = 30000\n- 36000 - 8y + 4.25y = 30000\n- -3.75y = -6000\n- y = 1600\n\n7.

If the drain stays open unnoticed , how long will it take to fill the tub with water ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": ":\n\n1. Let's first consider how much water fills the tub in 1 minute with the faucet on and drain open. We can assume that the faucet fills the bathtub at a constant rate, let's call it 'F'. At the same time, the drain removes water from the tub at a constant rate, let's call it 'D'. Since the drain is open, the net rate of water that enters the tub is F - D.\n\n2. We know that it takes 10 minutes to fill the tub with water with the drain closed, so in 1 minute with the drain closed, the faucet fills the tub with 1/10 of its total capacity (assuming the tub has a consistent volume). This means that F = 1/10 of the tub's volume per minute.\n\n3. We also know that it takes 12 minutes to drain the tub completely, which means that in 1 minute with the drain open, D = 1/12 of the tub's volume per minute.\n\n4. Now we can plug these values into our formula for the net rate of water that enters the tub: F - D = (1/10) - (1/12) = 1/60 of the tub's volume per minute.\n\n5. This means that each minute, the tub fills with 1/60 of its total capacity. To fill the entire tub with water, we need to add water equivalent to the tub's full capacity, which takes 1/(1/60) = 60 minutes.\n\nTherefore, if the drain stays open unnoticed, it will take 60 minutes to fill the tub with water."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nWe can approach this problem using the concept of relative speed. \n\nLet's assume that the two runners have speeds of x and y miles per hour. \n\nWhen they run in the same direction, their relative speed is (x-y) miles per hour, since they are moving away from each other. \n\nIn two hours, the distance between them would be 4 miles. Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write:\n\n4 = (x-y) x 2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx - y = 2\n\nNow let's consider the case when they run in opposite directions. Their relative speed would be (x+y) miles per hour, since they are moving towards each other. \n\nIn one hour, the distance between them would be 16 miles. Using the same formula as before, we can write:\n\n16 = (x+y) x 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx + y = 16\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (x and y).

How many cups of each size did kyle fill Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Write down what we know\n- Kyle served 24 cups of coffee\n- The total amount of coffee used was 384 ounces\n- The total amount collected was $30.60\n- We know the prices for each size of coffee\n\nStep 2: Set up equations\nLet's use variables to represent the number of cups of each size that Kyle served:\n- Let x be the number of 10 oz. cups\n- Let y be the number of 14 oz. cups\n- Let z be the number of 20 oz. cups\n\nWe can use these variables to set up equations based on the information given:\n- Equation 1: x + y + z = 24 (because Kyle served a total of 24 cups)\n- Equation 2: 10x + 14y + 20z = 384 (because 384 ounces of coffee were used)\n- Equation 3: 0.95x + 1.15y + 1.5z = 30.6 (because the total collected was $30.60)\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations\nWe have three equations and three variables, so we can use algebra to solve for x, y, and z. One possible method is to use the first equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other two, and then substitute into the other two equations to get a system of two equations in two variables. Then we can use any method of solving systems of equations (such as substitution or elimination) to find x, y, and z.\n\nHere's one way to do it:\n- From Equation 1, we can solve for z: z = 24 - x - y\n- Substituting into Equation 2, we get: 10x + 14y + 20(24 - x - y) = 384\nSimplifying, we get: 10x + 14y + 480 - 20x - 20y = 384\nCombining like terms, we get: -10x - 6y = -96\nDividing everything by -2, we get: 5x + 3y = 48\n- Substituting into Equation 3, we get: 0.95x + 1.15y + 1.5(24 - x - y) = 30.6\nSimplifying, we get: -0.55x - 0.35y = -6.6\nMultiplying everything by -20 (to get rid of the decimals), we get: 11x + 7y = 132\n\nNow we have a system of two equations in two variables:\n5x + 3y = 48\n11x + 7y = 132\n\nWe can solve this using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n- Multiply the first equation by 11: 55x + 33y = 528\n- Multiply the second equation by -5: -55x - 35y = -660\n- Add the two equations: -2y = -132\n- Divide both sides by -2: y = 66\n\nThis means that Kyle served 66 14 oz. cups. We can substitute this into any of the three equations to solve for x and z. Let's use Equation 1:\nx + 66 + z = 24\nx + z = -42\nz = -42 - x\n\nNow let's use Equation 2 (which is the same as the one we simplified earlier):\n10x + 14y + 20z = 384\n10x + 14(66) + 20(-42 - x) = 384\nSimplifying, we get: -6x + 489 = 384\nSubtracting 489 from both sides, we get: -6x = -105\nDividing both sides by -6, we get: x = 17.5 (this is a fraction, but it makes sense because Kyle can serve a fractional number of 10 oz. cups)\n\nFinally, we can substitute x and y into the equation we got for z earlier:\nz = -42 - x\nz = -42 - 17.5\nz = -59.5 (this is negative, but it makes sense because Kyle can't serve a negative number of 20 oz. cups)\n\nStep 4: Check the solution\nWe found that Kyle served 17.5 10 oz. cups, 66 14 oz. cups, and -59.5 20 oz. cups. This doesn't make sense because you can't serve a negative number of cups. What went wrong?\n\nStep 5: Find the mistake\nLooking at the equations we set up, we see that we made a mistake when we solved for z in terms of x and y. Specifically, we assumed that x + y + z = 24, but we didn't know that the number of cups of each size had to add up to 24. In fact, we only know that the total number of cups served was 24. So the correct equation should be z = 24 - x - y.\n\nStep 6: Correct the mistake and solve again\nUsing the correct equation for z, we get:\nz = 24 - x - y\n\nSubstituting this into Equation 2, we get:\n10x + 14y + 20(24 - x - y) = 384\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n-6x - 6y = -96\n\nDividing both sides by -6, we get:\nx + y = 16\n\nSubstituting this into Equation 3, we get:\n0.95x + 1.15y + 1.5(24 - x - y) = 30.6\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n0.55x + 0.35y = 4.2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20, we get:\n11x + 7y = 84\n\nSolving this system of equations using elimination, we get:\nx = 4\ny = 12\nz = 8\n\nSo Kyle served 4 10 oz. cups, 12 14 oz. cups, and 8 20 oz. cups.\n\nStep 7: Check the solution\nDoes this solution make sense? Let's check:\n- 4 10 oz. cups at 95 cents each = $3.80\n- 12 14 oz. cups at $1.15 each = $13.80\n- 8 20 oz. cups at $1.50 each = $12.00\n- Total collected = $3.80 + $13.80 + $12.00 = $29.60\n- This is close to the total amount collected in the problem ($30.60) but not exactly the same. It's possible that there was a rounding error somewhere, or that the problem is not perfectly consistent. Nevertheless, our solution seems to be reasonable based on the given information."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost per game\n\nTo calculate the cost per game, we need to add up the initial investment in equipment and the cost of manufacturing each game:\n\nCost per game = (Initial investment + Manufacturing cost per game)\nCost per game = ($10,410 + $2.65)\nCost per game = $10,412.65\n\nStep 2: Calculate the profit per game\n\nTo calculate the profit per game, we need to subtract the cost per game from the selling price:\n\nProfit per game = Selling price - Cost per game\nProfit per game = $20 - $10,412.65\nProfit per game = -$10,392.65\n\nNegative profit per game indicates that we are losing money on each game we sell. Therefore, to break even, we need to sell enough games to cover our initial investment and manufacturing costs.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of games to break even\n\nTo break even, the total revenue from selling the games must be equal to the total cost (initial investment + manufacturing cost). We can set up the equation as follows:\n\nTotal revenue = Total cost\nNumber of games sold x Selling price = Initial investment + (Manufacturing cost per game x Number of games sold)\n\nSubstituting the numbers, we get:\n\nN x $20 = $10,410 + ($2.65 x N)\nWhere N = the number of games sold\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nN x $20 = $10,410 + $2.65N\nN($20 - $2.65) = $10,410\nN = $10,410 / $17.35\nN \u2248 600.57\n\nTherefore, we need to sell at least 601 games to break even."}

Let x be the amount of 10% solution needed and y be the amount of 1% solution needed. The total volume of the mixture is 15 mL, so we can write:\n\nx + y = 15\n\nTo determine the ratio of the two solutions, we need to consider the amount of active ingredient each solution contributes.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following formula:\n\nTime = Work / Rate\n\nwhere:\n\n- Time is the time it takes to paint the car (in days)\n- Work is the amount of work to be done (which in this case is painting a car)\n- Rate is the rate of work (which is the amount of work done per unit of time, such as days)\n\nLet's start by figuring out how long it takes Jose to paint the car on his own. According to the problem statement, Jose can paint the car in 7 days, so we can write:\n\nTime_Jose = Work / Rate_Jose\n\n7 = Work / Rate_Jose\n\nTo solve for the rate of work (Rate_Jose), we can rearrange the formula:\n\nRate_Jose = Work / Time_Jose\n\nRate_Jose = Work / 7\n\nNow let's do the same for Alex. According to the problem statement, Alex can paint the car in 5 days, so we can write:\n\nTime_Alex = Work / Rate_Alex\n\n5 = Work / Rate_Alex\n\nTo solve for the rate of work (Rate_Alex), we can rearrange the formula:\n\nRate_Alex = Work / Time_Alex\n\nRate_Alex = Work / 5\n\nNow we need to figure out how long it will take Jose and Alex together to paint the car. We can use the formula:\n\nTime_Together = Work / Rate_Together\n\nWe know that the two painters are working together, so their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates:\n\nRate_Together = Rate_Jose + Rate_Alex\n\nRate_Together = (Work / 7) + (Work / 5)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:\n\nRate_Together = (5*Work + 7*Work) / (5*7)\n\nRate_Together = 12*Work / 35\n\nNow we can plug this rate into the formula for Time_Together:\n\nTime_Together = Work / (12*Work / 35)\n\nTime_Together = 35 / 12\n\nTime_Together = 2.92 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nSo it will take Jose and Alex together about 2.92 days to paint the car."}

Let's call that time 't'. We can set up an equation for Train A:\n\nd = rt\n260 = 70t\n\nSolving for 't':\n\nt = 260 / 70\nt = 3.71 hours (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThis means that Train A will reach the meeting point in 3.71 hours.\n\nNow, let's use the same formula for Train B. We don't know the distance Train B travels, but we do know that it will travel for the same amount of time as Train A. So:\n\nd = rt\nd = 60 * 3.71\nd = 222.6 miles\n\nThis means that Train B will travel 222.6 miles before it meets Train A.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total distance the two trains travel before they meet.\n\nSince Train A is traveling 260 miles and Train B is traveling 222.6 miles, we can add those two distances together to find the total distance the two trains travel before they meet:\n\n260 + 222.6 = 482.6 miles\n\nSo the two trains will travel a total of 482.6 miles before they meet.\n\nStep 5: Use the formula distance = rate x time to solve for the time it takes for Train B to travel 222.6 miles.\n\nWe already know that Train A travels 260 miles in 3.71 hours. Now we need to find out how long it takes Train B to travel 222.6 miles:\n\nd = rt\n222.6 = 60t\n\nSolving for 't':\n\nt = 222.6 / 60\nt = 3.71 hours (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThis means that Train B will also reach the meeting point in 3.71 hours.\n\nStep 6: Add the times for Train A and Train B to find the total time it takes for the two trains to meet.\n\nSince both trains will reach the meeting point in 3.71 hours, we can add those two times to find the total time it takes for the two trains to meet:\n\n3.71 + 3.71 = 7.42 hours\n\nSo the two trains will meet in 7.42 hours.\n\nAnswer: The two trains will meet in 7.42 hours."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nLet's begin by using algebra to represent the information given in the problem. \n\nLet's call Todd's age 'T' (in years). \n\nAccording to the problem, Tom is 4 times as old as Todd, so we can write: \n\nTom's age = 4T \n\nNext, the problem tells us that in 7 years, Tom's age will be 5 years less than 3 times as old as Todd. So we can use algebra again to write: \n\n(Tom's age + 7) = 3(T + 7) - 5 \n\nLet's simplify this equation: \n\nTom's age + 7 = 3T + 16 \n\nTom's age = 3T + 9 \n\nNow we can use substitution to solve for Todd's age. We know that Tom's age is 4 times Todd's age, so we can substitute 4T for Tom's age in the equation above: \n\n4T = 3T + 9 \n\nSubtracting 3T from both sides: \n\nT = 9 \n\nTherefore, Todd is 9 years old. \n\nTo check our answer, we can go back to the equation we simplified earlier: \n\nTom's age + 7 = 3T + 16 \n\nIf Todd is 9 years old, then Tom's age is: \n\nTom's age = 4T = 4(9) = 36 \n\nChecking the equation: \n\nTom's age + 7 = 36 + 7 = 43 \n\n3T + 16 = 3(9) + 16 = 43 \n\nSo the equation holds true, and we can be confident that our answer is correct."}

So she then paddled back home -LRB- downstream -RRB- , If the entire trip , up stream and back took her 8 hours , how far up stream was the ice cream parlor from her home ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n1. Let's assume the distance between Rita's home and the ice cream parlor is x miles.\n\n2. If Rita paddles up stream, against the current, her speed will be 3 mph - the speed of the river's current. So her effective speed up stream will be 3 - c mph, where c is the speed of the river's current.\n\n3. Similarly, if Rita paddles down stream, with the current, her effective speed down stream will be 3 + c mph.\n\n4. We know that the time it took Rita to paddle up stream was the same as the time it took her to paddle back down stream. Let's call this time t.\n\n5. That means the distance she covered going up stream was x miles and the distance she covered going down stream was also x miles.\n\n6. Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write:\n\n Distance up stream = (3 - c) * t\n\n Distance down stream = (3 + c) * t\n\n7. We also know that the total time taken for the entire trip was 8 hours. So we can write:\n\n Time taken up stream + Time taken down stream = 8\n\n t + t = 8\n\n 2t = 8\n\n t = 4 hours\n\n8. Now we can substitute t = 4 hours into the formulas we got earlier:\n\n Distance up stream = (3 - c) * t = (3 - c) * 4 = 12 - 4c\n\n Distance down stream = (3 + c) * t = (3 + c) * 4 = 12 + 4c\n\n9. We know that the distance up stream is the same as the distance down stream:\n\n 12 - 4c = 12 + 4c\n\n 8c = 0\n\n c = 0\n\n10. This means the speed of the river's current is 0 mph. So the river is not flowing and there is no current to contend with.\n\n11. With no current, Rita's effective speed up stream and down stream is simply 3 mph and 9 mph, respectively.\n\n12. We can use the formula distance = speed x time to calculate Rita's distance up stream:\n\n Distance up stream = 3 * t = 3 * 4 = 12 miles\n\nSo the ice cream parlor is 12 miles upstream from Rita's home."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nThere are two parts to this problem: finding the distance to work and then using that to solve for the time. \n\n1. Finding the distance to work: \n\nLet's call the distance to work 'd.' \n\nWe know that the time it takes for Juan to drive to work at 22 miles per hour is equal to the time it takes for him to drive home at 32 miles per hour. \n\nLet's call the time it takes for him to drive to work 't1' and the time it takes for him to drive home 't2.' \n\nWe can set up two equations: \n\nd = 22t1  (distance to work = speed x time) \nd = 32t2  (distance home = speed x time) \n\nWe also know that the total travel time is 2.25 hours: \n\nt1 + t2 = 2.25 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (d and t1/t2) and one additional equation. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the third equation. \n\nSolving for t1 in terms of t2: \n\nd = 22t1  --> t1 = d/22 \nd = 32t2  --> t2 = d/32 \n\nSubstituting into t1 + t2 = 2.25: \n\nd/22 + d/32 = 2.25 \n\n2. Solving for the distance to work (d): \n\nNow we just need to solve for the distance to work (d). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators (22 and 32), which is 352: \n\n352(d/22) + 352(d/32) = 352(2.25) \n\n16d + 11d = 792 \n\n27d = 792 \n\nd = 29.33 \n\nSo the distance to work is approximately 29.33 miles. \n\n3. Solving for the time it takes to get to work (t1) and the time it takes to get home (t2): \n\nNow that we know the distance to work, we can solve for the time it takes Juan to get to work and the time it takes him to get home. \n\nt1 = d/22 = 29.33/22 = 1.33 hours (rounded to two decimal places) \nt2 = d/32 = 29.33/32 = 0.92 hours (rounded to two decimal places) \n\nSo, it takes Juan 1.33 hours (about 1 hour and 20 minutes) to get to work and 0.92 hours (about 55 minutes) to get home."}

Please help !!! Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nLet's start by assuming that the larger pipe can fill the pool in x hours and the smaller pipe can do it in y hours.\n\nAccording to the problem, we know that both pipes can fill the pool in 12 hours. So we can write:\n\n1/x + 1/y = 1/12     (Equation 1)\n\nNow, let's see what happens when the larger pipe is used for 4 hours and the smaller pipe for 9 hours. In this case, we can say that:\n\n4/x + 9/y = 1/2     (Equation 2)\n\nThis is because using the larger pipe for 4 hours fills 4/x of the pool and using the smaller pipe for 9 hours fills 9/y of the pool, which adds up to half the pool.\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables (x and y) that we can solve simultaneously. To do this, we can use algebraic manipulation to eliminate one of the variables.\n\nFirst, let's multiply Equation 1 by (9y/108) and Equation 2 by (12xy) to get rid of the denominators and simplify the equations:\n\n9y/12xy + 9y/108 = y/12\n48x + 27y = xy     (Equation 3)\n\n48xy + 27xy = 54x^2y^2\n75xy = 54x^2y^2\n25/18 = xy     (Equation 4)\n\nNow, we can substitute Equation 4 into Equation 3 to get:\n\n48x + 27(25/18x) = 25/18x\n648x + 27(25x) = 25x\n648x + 675x = 450x\nx = 27\n\nSo the larger pipe can fill the pool in 27 hours. Substituting this back into Equation 1 or Equation 4, we can solve for y:\n\n1/27 + 1/y = 1/12\ny = 108\n\nTherefore, the smaller pipe can fill the pool in 108 hours.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The larger pipe can fill the pool in 27 hours.\n- The smaller pipe can fill the pool in 108 hours."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n:\n\n1. Let's start by using the formula:\n\ndistance = velocity x time\n\nWe know that the total distance of the biathlon is 155 miles and the total time is 6 hours. Therefore:\n\n155 = (velocity of run x time of run) + (velocity of bike x time of bike)\n\n2. We don't know the distances yet, but we do know the times for each segment. Let r be the distance of the run and b be the distance of the bike ride. Then we can write:\n\nr/10 + b/29 = 6\n\n3. We have two equations with two unknowns:\n\n155 = (velocity of run x time of run) + (velocity of bike x time of bike)\nr/10 + b/29 = 6\n\nWe can use substitution to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for b in the second equation:\n\nb/29 = 6 - r/10\n\nb = 29(6) - 29(r/10)\n\nb = 174 - 2.9r\n\n4. Now we can substitute this expression for b into the first equation:\n\n155 = (velocity of run x time of run) + (velocity of bike x time of bike)\nr/10 + (174 - 2.9r)/29 = 6\n\n5. Solve for r:\n\nr/10 + 6 - 0.1r = 6\n0.9r/10 = 0\nr = 0\n\nThis doesn't make sense! We must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\n6. Let's go back and check our work. We can start by checking if the units are consistent:\n\n155 miles = (10 miles/hour x time of run) + (29 miles/hour x time of bike)\n\nThe units on the left-hand side are miles, which is consistent with the total distance of the biathlon. The units on the right-hand side are miles/hour times hours, which simplifies to miles, which is also consistent.\n\n7. Let's try a different approach. We can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / velocity\n\nLet R be the time for the run and B be the time for the bike ride. Then we can write:\n\nR + B = 6\n\nand\n\nr / 10 = R, b / 29 = B\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:\n\nr/10 + b/29 = 6\n\nwhich is the same equation we had before.\n\n8. We could solve for one variable using the second equation, as before. But instead, let's solve for B in the first equation:\n\nB = 6 - R\n\nSubstituting this expression into the second equation, we get:\n\nb / 29 = 6 - R\n\nb = 29(6 - R)\n\nb = 174 - 29R\n\n9. Now we can substitute these expressions for b and R into the original equation:\n\n155 = (velocity of run x time of run) + (velocity of bike x time of bike)\n\nr/10 + (174 - 29R)/29 = 6\n\nr/10 + 6 - R = 6\n\nr/10 = R\n\n10. This tells us that the distance of the run is equal to its velocity times its time, or:\n\nr = 10 x R = 10 x (6 - B) = 10 x (6 - (174 - 29R)/29)\n\nr = 9R - 60 = 9(6 - B) - 60 = 54 - 9B\n\n11. We can substitute this expression for r into the second equation:\n\nb / 29 = 6 - R\n\nb = 29(6 - R)\n\nb = 174 - 29R\n\nb = 174 - 29(r/10)\n\nb = 174 - 2.9r\n\n12. Now we have two equations with one unknown each:\n\nr = 54 - 9B\nb = 174 - 2.9r\n\nWe can use substitution to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for b in the second equation:\n\nb = 174 - 2.9r\nb = 174 - 2.9(54 - 9B)\nb = 132.6 - 26.1B\n\n13. Now we can substitute this expression for b into the first equation:\n\n155 = r + b\n155 = (54 - 9B) + (132.6 - 26.1B)\n155 = 186.6 - 35B\n35B = 31.6\nB = 0.9029\n\n14. Finally, we can use this value of B to find the distance of the run:\n\nR = 6 - B\nR = 6 - 0.9029\nR = 5.0971\n\nr = 10 x R\nr = 50.971 miles\n\nb = 29 x B\nb = 26.183 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance of the run is 50.971 miles and the distance of the bike race is 26.183 miles."}

One train leaves Howard traveling towards Rineville at an average speed of 30 mph . Another train leaves Rineville at the same time traveling towards Howard at an average speed of 45 mph . How long will it take them to meet ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the direction of each train\nThe train leaving Howard is traveling towards Rineville and the train leaving Rineville is traveling towards Howard.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the combined speed of both trains\nTo find the combined speed of both trains, we add their individual speeds. Therefore, the combined speed of both trains is 30 mph + 45 mph = 75 mph.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the distance they need to cover to meet\nSince the trains are moving towards each other, the distance they need to cover to meet is simply the sum of the distance they each travel. Therefore, the distance they need to cover to meet is 100 miles.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the time it will take for them to meet\nTo calculate the time it will take for them to meet, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. Therefore, the time it will take for them to meet is:\n\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = 100 miles / 75 mph\ntime = 1.33 hours or 80 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take the two trains 1.33 hours or 80 minutes to meet each other."}

Find the number . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n\nLet's start by translating the problem into an equation.\n\nWe're told that one-third of a number of two digits is greater than one-fourth of its successor by 1. Let's call the number x. \n\nThen, one-third of x is (1/3)x, and its successor (the number that comes after x) is x+1. \n\nSo, according to the problem:\n\n(1/3)x > (1/4)(x+1) + 1\n\nNow we can solve for x. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4), we get:\n\n4x > 3(x+1) + 12\n\nExpanding the brackets, we get:\n\n4x > 3x + 3 + 12\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx > 15\n\nSo the number must be greater than 15. But we know that the number has two digits. So what could it be?\n\nThe smallest two-digit number greater than 15 is 16. Let's check if it works in the original equation:\n\n(1/3)*16 > (1/4)*(16+1) + 1\n\n16/3 > 17/4\n\nThis is true, so the solution is x = 16.\n\nTherefore, the number in question is 16."}

Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's use 'B' for the number of boys and 'G' for the number of girls.\n2. We know from the problem that the number of boys is 5 less than twice the number of girls, so we can write an equation: B = 2G - 5.\n3. We also know that the class size is 28, so the total number of girls and boys must add up to 28. We can write another equation: B + G = 28.\n4. We now have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for B. Let's substitute B = 2G - 5 from the first equation into the second equation: (2G - 5) + G = 28.\n5.

Ana saves $50 per day, while Ojo spends $70 per day:\n\nAna's savings per day = $50\nOjo's spending per day = -$70 (since spending is a negative change in the amount)\n\nTo find out how many days it will take for them to have the same amount, we need to divide the difference in their current amounts by the combined change in their amounts per day:\n\n1560 / (50 - 70) = 78\n\nSo it will take 78 days for them to have the same amount. However, we need to be careful here because Ojo is spending more than Ana is saving, which means his amount will decrease faster. Let's check if they actually have the same amount after 78 days:\n\nAna's amount after 78 days = 300 + (50 x 78) = 4050\nOjo's amount after 78 days = 1860 - (70 x 78) = 840\n\nAs we can see, they don't have the same amount after 78 days. Ana has a much larger amount than Ojo. This makes sense because Ana is saving more per day than Ojo is spending. To find out when they will have the same amount, we need to find the number of days it will take for their amounts to be equal:\n\n300 + (50 x days) = 1860 - (70 x days)\n120 x days = 1560\ndays = 13\n\nSo it will take 13 days for Ana and Ojo to have the same amount, and they will both have $1170."}

So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDesired Profit Margin = (30 / 80) x 100% = 37.5%\n\nTherefore, the retailer wants to earn a profit of 37.5% on each pair of pants.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the retailer's selling price\nTo calculate the retailer's selling price, we can use the following formula:\nSelling Price = Cost + Profit\n\nHere, the cost of each pair of pants is $80, and the desired profit is 37.5%. So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nProfit = 0.375 x 80 = $30\nSelling Price = Cost + Profit = $80 + $30 = $110\n\nTherefore, the retailer needs to sell each pair of pants for $110 to earn a profit of 37.5%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the discount\nThe retailer wants to sell the pants at a 20% discount off the selling price.
