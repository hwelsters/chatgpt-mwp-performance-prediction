	Abstract
</h2>

<p align="left">
	We study the performance of a commercially available large language model (LLM) known as ChatGPT on
	math word problems (MWPs) from the dataset DRAW-1K. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	We also have released the dataset of ChatGPT’s responses to the MWPs to
	support further work on the characterization of LLM performance and present baseline machine learning
	models to predict if ChatGPT can correctly answer an MWP. We have released a dataset comprised of
	ChatGPT’s responses to support further research in this area.
