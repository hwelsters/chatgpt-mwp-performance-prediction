Based on the ideas of a few attendees at AAAI MAKE.
- Asking ChatGPT to correct itself and then further gauging its performance.
- Study ChatGPT's nondeterminism
- Compare working correctness with solution correctness (in some cases, the working is correct while the solution is wrong or vice-versa)

TODO:
- [ðŸ¦œ] Ask ChatGPT to tag parts of response (Abhinav)

- [] JSON formatting prompt engineering
- [] Overall stats on accuracy
- [] ML models using JSON output as features. 5 cross fold. Natural split
- [] BERT tagging
- [] Second ML models JSON + BERT tags

INTERESTING THINGS:
- [] Now that we're using JSON instead, we can also... check the accuracy of the equations!
