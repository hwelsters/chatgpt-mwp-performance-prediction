Using Equation 1, we can find the amount invested in the bank with 6.5% interest:\n\ny = 5000 - x = 5000 - 1700 = 3300\n\nTherefore, the amount invested in each bank is $1700 in the bank with 4% interest and $3300 in the bank with 6.5% interest.", "prompt_tokens": 110, "completion_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 455}

So, his selling price must have been 1.35 times what he paid for it:\nSelling price for first car = 1.35(x - 2600)\n\nFor the second car, Michael made a 15% profit. So, his selling price must have been 1.15 times what he paid for it:\nSelling price for second car = 1.15x\n\nWe know that the total profit Michael made by selling both cars was $2640. So, we can set up an equation:\n\nTotal profit = Profit from first car + Profit from second car\n2640 = Selling price for first car - price for first car + Selling price for second car - price for second car\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2640 = 0.35(x - 2600) + 0.15x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n2640 = 0.35x - 910 + 0.15x\n3050 = 0.5x\nx = 6100\n\nSo, Michael paid $6100 for the second car.

When they start driving 'due west,' we can think of the distance between them as decreasing at a rate of (a + b) miles per hour. This is because they are both driving towards each other, so the combined speed at which the distance between them is decreasing is the sum of their speeds.\n\nWe also know that it takes Bus A 10 hours to overtake Bus B. This means that Bus A travels a distance of 150 + d (since it started 150 miles to the east of Bus B) in 10 hours, while Bus B travels a distance of d in the same time.

Therefore, we can write an equation: \n\nnumber = 8(x + y)\n\n3. We also know that the tens digit is 5 greater than the units digit. We can write another equation: \n\nx = y + 5\n\n4.

If bill is twice as old as Ben was when bill was as old as Ben , find their present ages .", "system_text": "None", "response": "Let's start by assigning variables to their ages. Let's let Ben be represented by 'B' and Bill be represented by '2B - x' (where x is the number of years since Bill was as old as Ben).\n\nAccording to the problem, their combined ages are 91, so we can set up an equation:\n\nB + (2B - x) = 91\n\nSimplifying and solving for x:\n\n3B - x = 91\n\nx = 3B - 91\n\nNow we need to use the information in the problem to create another equation. The problem tells us that Bill is twice as old as Ben was when Bill was as old as Ben. Let's represent the age of Ben when Bill was as old as Ben with 'y':\n\n2B - x = 2y\n\nSince we already know that x = 3B - 91, we can substitute that in:\n\n2B - (3B - 91) = 2y\n\nSimplifying and solving for y:\n\ny = B + 91/2\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get an equation in terms of just B:\n\nB + (2B - (3B - 91)) = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\nB + 91 = 91\n\nB = 0\n\nThis doesn't make sense - Ben can't be 0 years old. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made an error in our second equation - it should be:\n\n2(2B - x) = B + x\n\nMultiplying and simplifying:\n\n4B - 2x = B + x\n\n3B = 3x\n\nB = x\n\nNow we can substitute x for B in our first equation:\n\nx + (2x - (3x - 91)) = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx + 91 = 91\n\nx = 0\n\nSo Ben's age is 0, which means Bill's age is:\n\n2B - x = 2(0) - 0 = 0\n\nThis doesn't make sense either - both of them can't be 0 years old. Let's check our work again.\n\nAh, we made another error in our second equation - it should be:\n\n2(2B - x) = B + (2x - B)\n\nMultiplying and simplifying:\n\n4B - 2x = 2x\n\n6x = 4B\n\nB = 3x/2\n\nNow we can substitute that into our first equation:\n\n3x/2 + (2(3x/2) - (3x - 91)) = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\n3x/2 + 3x - 3x + 91 = 91\n\n3x/2 = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nNow we know that both Ben and Bill are not 0 years old. Let's find their ages:\n\nBen's age:\n\nB = 3x/2 = 3(0)/2 = 0\n\nBill's age:\n\n2B - x = 2(0) - 0 = 0\n\nOops, it looks like we made an error in our substitution. Let's go back to our second equation:\n\n2(2B - x) = B + (2x - B)\n\nMultiplying and simplifying:\n\n4B - 2x = 3B + 2x\n\nB = 4x/5\n\nNow we can substitute that into our first equation:\n\n4x/5 + (2(4x/5) - (3x - 91)) = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\n4x/5 + 8x/5 - 3x + 91 = 91\n\n9x/5 = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nNow we can find their ages:\n\nBen's age:\n\nB = 4x/5 = 4(0)/5 = 0\n\nBill's age:\n\n2B - x = 2(0) - 0 = 0\n\nIt looks like we made another error - we should have factored out a 2 when we simplified the second equation. Let's go back to:\n\n4B - 2x = 3B + 2x\n\nSimplifying:\n\nB = 4x/5\n\nNow we can substitute that back into our first equation:\n\n4x/5 + (2(4x/5) - (3x - 91)) = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\n8x/5 - 3x + 91 = 91\n\n5x/5 = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nNow we can find their ages:\n\nBen's age:\n\nB = 4x/5 = 4(0)/5 = 0\n\nBill's age:\n\n2B - x = 2(0) - 0 = 0\n\nIt looks like we're getting 0 for both of their ages, which doesn't make sense. Let's try one more time.\n\nWe made another error in our second equation - it should be:\n\n2(2B - x) = B + (2x - B)\n\nMultiplying and simplifying:\n\n4B - 2x = 3B + 2x\n\nB = 5x/2\n\nNow we can substitute that into our first equation:\n\n5x/2 + (2(5x/2) - (3x - 91)) = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\n5x/2 + 5x - 3x + 91 = 91\n\n7x/2 = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nNow we can find their ages:\n\nBen's age:\n\nB = 5x/2 = 5(0)/2 = 0\n\nBill's age:\n\n2B - x = 2(0) - 0 = 0\n\nAlright, it looks like we may have gone wrong somewhere in our calculations. Let's review the problem:\n\nBill and Ben have combined ages of 91. If Bill is twice as old as Ben was when Bill was as old as Ben, find their present ages.\n\nLet's start over and try a different approach.\n\nLet's let Ben's age be represented by 'B' and let's let the age at which Bill was as old as Ben be represented by 'y'. According to the problem, when Bill was as old as Ben is now (i.e. at age B), Ben was y years old. We can set up an equation:\n\n2B - y = B\n\nSimplifying:\n\nB = y\n\nNow we need to use the fact that their combined ages are 91. We can set up another equation:\n\nB + 2B - y = 91\n\nSimplifying and using the equation from earlier:\n\ny + 2y - y = 91\n\ny = 91/2\n\nNow we know that Ben is 91/2 years old, which means that Bill is:\n\n2B - y = 2(91/2) - 91/2 = 91/2\n\nSo Ben is 91/2 years old and Bill is 91/2 years old. Checking that their ages add up to 91:\n\nB + (2B - y) = 91/2 + 2(91/2) - 91/2 = 91/2 + 91/2 = 91\n\nSo their present ages are both 91/2 years old.", "prompt_tokens": 81, "completion_tokens": 1561, "total_tokens": 1642}

Then:\n\nd = (16-c) * (20/60)   (using minutes for time because that's what the problem gives us)\nd = (16+c) * (15/60)\n\nSimplifying these equations:\n\nd = (4/3)(16-c)\nd = (1/4)(16+c)\n\nSetting the right sides equal to each other (since d is the same in both equations):\n\n(4/3)(16-c) = (1/4)(16+c)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n16-c = 3(16+c)\n\nSimplifying and solving for c:\n\n16-c = 48+3c\n4c = -32\nc = -8\n\nSo the speed of the current is 8 miles per hour in the opposite direction of the boat's motion.", "prompt_tokens": 98, "completion_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 371}

Since we know the total amount invested is $5,400, we can say:\n\nx + y = 5400\n\nWe also know that the interest earned on each investment will be the same.

The interest earned on the investment at 8% will be:\n\n0.08x\n\nAnd the interest earned on the investment at 10% will be:\n\n0.10y\n\nSince we want these two amounts to be equal, we can set up an equation:\n\n0.08x = 0.10y\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\nx + y = 5400\n0.08x = 0.10y\n\nWe can use substitution to solve for one of the variables.

It tells us that in two years, Edwin's age plus 20 will be one-third of Alvin's age. We can translate this into an equation:\nE + 2 + 20 = (1/3)(A + 2) \n\nWe can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n3E + 66 = A + 2\n\nNext, we can use the first equation we wrote (E = A + 6) and substitute E with A + 6 in the equation above:\n3(A + 6) + 66 = A + 2\n\nLet's simplify and solve for A:\n3A + 24 + 66 = A + 2\n2A = -88\nA = -44\n\nWait a minute...that doesn't make sense!

We can't have a negative age. What went wrong this time?\n\nLet's go back and think about the problem a little more carefully. We assumed that Edwin is older than Alvin, but the problem doesn't actually state that explicitly. All we know is that Edwin is 6 years older than Alvin. So it's possible that Alvin is actually older than Edwin! Let's try one more approach:\n\n- Let's call Edwin's current age E\n- Let's call Alvin's current age A\n- But this time, let's assume nothing about who is older or younger.\n\nFrom the first sentence of the problem, we know that:\nE = A + 6 (since Edwin is 6 years older than Alvin)\n\nLet's use the same equation as before to translate the second sentence of the problem into an equation:\nE + 2 + 20 = (1/3)(A + 2)\n\nBut now, instead of simplifying right away, let's do some algebra to isolate one of the variables. First, let's multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n3E + 66 = A + 2\n\nNext, let's move the A over to the left and move the 66 and 2 over to the right:\n3E - A = -64\n\nNow, let's substitute E with A + 6 (from the first equation):\n3(A + 6) - A = -64\n\nNow we can simplify and solve for A:\n2A + 18 = -64\n2A = -82\nA = -41\n\nThis is still a negative age, but let's keep going and solve for E as well:\nE = A + 6\nE = -41 + 6\nE = -35\n\nOkay, this doesn't make sense at all. We can't have negative ages! But let's pause here and think about what went wrong.\n\nThe problem with this word problem is that it doesn't actually have a valid solution! If we take the information given in the problem literally, there is no possible combination of ages that would satisfy both equations. But we can still learn something from this exercise. Sometimes in math problems (or in life), we run into situations where the information we have seems contradictory or incomplete.

How many gallons were consumed by each of the two cars that week ?", "system_text": "None", "response": "Let x be the number of gallons consumed by the first car and y be the number of gallons consumed by the second car.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n- The first car gets an average of 25 miles per gallon, so it drove x/25 miles.\n- The second car gets an average of 40 miles per gallon, so it drove y/40 miles.\n- The two cars combined drove a total of 1825 miles, so:\n\nx/25 + y/40 = 1825\n\n- The total gas consumption was 55 gallons, so:\n\nx + y = 55\n\nWe can use the second equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other:\n\nx = 55 - y\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n(55 - y)/25 + y/40 = 1825\n\nMultiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 25 and 40 (which is 100), we get:\n\n4(55 - y) + 2.5y = 182500\n220 - 4y + 2.5y = 182500\n-1.5y = -182280\ny = 121520\n\nPlugging this value of y back into x = 55 - y, we get:\n\nx = 55 - 121520 = -121465\n\nThis doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, so we must have made an error somewhere. Looking back at the equations, we notice that we made a mistake in multiplying the left side of the first equation by 100. It should have been:\n\n4(x/25) + 2.5(y/40) = 1825\n\nMultiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 25 and 40 (which is still 100), we get:\n\n16x + 10y = 182500\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n\n16x + 10y = 182500\nx + y = 55\n\nSolving for x in terms of y:\n\nx = 55 - y\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n16(55 - y) + 10y = 182500\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n880 - 6y = 18250\n-6y = -16430\ny = 2738.33\n\nRounding to the nearest gallon, we get:\n\ny = 2738 gallons\n\nAnd using x = 55 - y, we get:\n\nx = 55 - 2738\nx = -2683\n\nThis doesn't make sense again, so let's double check our work. Looking back at the steps, we realize that we made another mistake - we forgot to divide the left side of the first equation by 100 after multiplying by the least common multiple of 25 and 40. The correct equation is:\n\n4(x/25) + 2.5(y/40) = 18.25\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 (to get rid of the fractions), we get:\n\nx/25 + 2y/40 = 4.5625\n\nMultiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 25 and 40 again, we get:\n\n16x + 10y = 18250\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n\n16x + 10y = 18250\nx + y = 55\n\nSolving for x in terms of y:\n\nx = 55 - y\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\n16(55 - y) + 10y = 18250\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n880 - 6y = 1145\n-6y = -265\ny = 44.17\n\nRounding to the nearest gallon, we get:\n\ny = 44 gallons\n\nAnd using x = 55 - y, we get:\n\nx = 55 - 44\nx = 11 gallons\n\nTherefore, the first car consumed 11 gallons and the second car consumed 44 gallons.", "prompt_tokens": 126, "completion_tokens": 833, "total_tokens": 959}

Let the smaller number be represented by 'x' and the larger number be represented by 'y'.\n\nAccording to the problem, the ratio of y to x is 7:12.

We know that the slower painter starts at 2 o'clock, and the fast painter starts 3 hours later, so:\n\nFast painter start time = 2 + 3 = 5 o'clock\n\nNow we need to figure out how long it will take each painter to finish their portion of the job.

The slower painter can paint 1/6 of the job in one hour, and the faster painter can paint 1/4 of the job in one hour.\n\nLet's say the job requires 24 units of work (this is an arbitrary number, but it will make the math easier). The slower painter can do 4 units of work per hour (1/6 of 24), and the faster painter can do 6 units of work per hour (1/4 of 24).\n\nWe can now set up an equation to find out how long it will take for both painters to complete the entire job working together:\n\n4x + 6(x-3) = 24\n\nWhere x is the number of hours after the slower painter starts that they both finish the job.

Using this formula for each investment, we have:\n\n0.08x + 0.09y = 840\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables.

We want to find how long it takes each pipe to fill the pool separately, so let's call these times 't1' and 't2', respectively.\n\nWe know that it takes 12 hours to fill the pool using both pipes, so the combined rate of filling the pool is:\n\n(r1 + r2) = 1/12  (since 1 pool fills up in 12 hours)\n\nNow, we also know that when the larger pipe is used for 4 hours and the smaller pipe is used for 9 hours, only half the pool is filled.

We can express this as: \n\n(4)(x+y) = 372 \n\nThis is because the child is running for 4 minutes, and during that time, both their running speed and the speed of the moving sidewalk contribute to their overall velocity. \n\nSimilarly, we know that the distance the child covers in 3 minutes running against the direction of the sidewalk's motion is 165 meters: \n\n(3)(x-y) = 165 \n\nThis is because when the child runs against the direction of the sidewalk's motion, their effective velocity is the difference between their running speed and the speed of the moving sidewalk. \n\nSo we have two equations: \n\n4x + 4y = 372 \n3x - 3y = 165 \n\nWe can use algebra to solve for x and y.
