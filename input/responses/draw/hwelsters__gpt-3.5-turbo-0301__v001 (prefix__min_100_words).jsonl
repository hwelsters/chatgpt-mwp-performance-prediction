Let's say Ben's current age is x and Bill's current age is y. \n\nWe know that their combined ages add up to 91: \n\nx + y = 91 \n\nWe also know that there was a point in time when Bill was as old as Ben. Let's say that happened m years ago, when Ben was x - m and Bill was y - m. \n\nWe can set up the equation: \n\ny - m = 2(x - m) \n\nNow, we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other, and substitute: \n\nx = 91 - y \n\ny - m = 2(x - m) \n\ny - m = 2(91 - y - m) \n\ny - m = 182 - 2y - 2m \n\n3y = 182 - m \n\nNow, we have an equation that relates the ages of Bill and Ben. We need another equation to solve for both variables. \n\nLet's go back to the equation that represents their combined ages: \n\nx + y = 91 \n\nWe can substitute x with 91 - y: \n\n(91 - y) + y = 91 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n91 = 91 \n\nThis equation doesn't give us any new information, but it confirms that our equations are consistent. \n\nGoing back to our previous equation: \n\n3y = 182 - m \n\nWe need to find a way to solve for both y and m. We can use another piece of information: Bill and Ben have combined ages of 91. \n\nx + y = 91 \n\n91 - y + y = 91 \n\nx = 91 - y \n\nWe know that y + x = 91.

If y was higher than that, m would be negative (which doesn't make sense), or Ben would be older than Bill (which contradicts the problem statement). \n\nIf y is 45.5, then m is 0. \n\n3(45.5) = 182 - 0 \n\n136.5 = 182 \n\nThis doesn't work. We need to try a lower value for y. \n\nLet's try y = 44. \n\n3(44) = 182 - m \n\n132 = 182 - m \n\nm = 50 \n\nWe found a solution! According to our equations, Ben is currently 44 years old, and Bill is currently 47 years old. \n\nWe can check our solution by verifying that at some point in the past, Bill was 2 times as old as Ben: \n\n47 - 50 = - 3 (so we're looking for a time 3 years ago) \n\nBen was 44 - 3 = 41 years old. \n\nBill was 44 years old 3 years ago. \n\n2(41) = 82 \n\n82 = 82 \n\nAt some point 3 years ago, Bill was 2 times as old as Ben.

We know that there are two buses that leave the station at the same time.

We have to calculate the time it will take for the two buses to be 460 miles apart.\n\nSince the two buses are moving in the opposite direction, their speeds are added up to calculate the relative speed between them.

We can substitute this into the second equation: \n8400 = 4(25)(8400 - 3d2) + 3d2 \n8400 = 100800 - 300d2 + 3d2 \n8400 = 100800 - 297d2 \nDividing by -297: \nd2 = -28.28 \n\nThis negative distance doesn't make sense, so let's double-check our work. We made an error when solving for time going east. It should be: \ntime going east = (7 - time going west) \u00f7 2 \n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for d1: \nd1 = 300 x ((7 - time going west) \u00f7 2) \nd1 = 1050 - 150time going west \n\nNow substituting this into the second equation: \n8400 = 4(1050 - 150time going west) + 3d2 \n8400 = 4200 - 600time going west + 3d2 \nDividing by 3: \n2800 = 1400 - 200time going west + d2 \n\nAgain, we can use the fact that the total flight time was 7 hours: \n7 = time going east + time going west \n7 = (1050 - 150time going west) \u00f7 300 + time going west \nMultiplying both sides by 300: \n2100 = 1050 - 150time going west + 300time going west \n1050 = 150time going west \ntime going west = 7 - (1050 \u00f7 300) \ntime going west = 3.5 hours \n\nNow we can solve for d2 using the second equation: \n2800 = 1400 - 200(3.5) + d2 \nd2 = 4900 \n\nFinally, we can solve for d1 using the first equation: \nd1 = 300 x ((7 - 3.5) \u00f7 2) \nd1 = 1050 \n\nTherefore, the plane traveled a total distance of d1 + d2 = 1050 + 4900 = 5950 km.", "prompt_tokens": 89, "completion_tokens": 852, "total_tokens": 941}

We know that the boat's speed upstream (against the current) is B - C and downstream (with the current) is B + C.\n\nLet the distance to the point upstream be d. Then, using the formula above, we get:\n\n(B - C) * 20/60 = d\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\nd = (B - C) * 1/3\n\nSimilarly, for the return trip, the distance is still d, but the time is 15 minutes:\n\n(B + C) * 15/60 = d\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\nd = (B + C) * 1/4\n\nNow we can set the two expressions for d equal to each other, since they represent the same distance:\n\n(B - C) * 1/3 = (B + C) * 1/4\n\nSimplifying and solving for C, we get:\n\nC = B/7\n\nSo the speed of the current is one-seventh (approximately 0.1429) of the speed of the boat relative to the water. In other words, if the boat is traveling at 16 mph relative to the water, then the speed of the current is approximately 2.286 mph.", "prompt_tokens": 73, "completion_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 373}

Let's assume that x represents the number of adult tickets sold and y represents the number of children tickets sold. We know that the sum of x and y is 750 because a total of 750 tickets were sold. Therefore, our first equation is:\n\nx + y = 750\n\nWe also know that the receipts for the performance were $3808.50, so the total amount of money earned from adult tickets is 7.5x and the total amount of money earned from children tickets is 4y. Therefore, our second equation is:\n\n7.5x + 4y = 3808.5\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which can be solved using substitution or elimination. Using substitution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other in the first equation, and then substitute that expression in the second equation to solve for the other variable. \n\nSolving for y in the first equation, we get:\n\ny = 750 - x\n\nSubstituting this expression for y in the second equation, we get:\n\n7.5x + 4(750 - x) = 3808.5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3.5x + 3000 = 3808.5\n\nSubtracting 3000 from both sides, we get:\n\n3.5x = 808.5\n\nDividing both sides by 3.5, we get:\n\nx = 231\n\nTherefore, we know that 231 adult tickets were sold. To find out how many children tickets were sold, we can substitute x = 231 in the first equation and solve for y:\n\n231 + y = 750\n\ny = 519\n\nTherefore, we know that 519 children tickets were sold. \n\nIn conclusion, we can determine that 231 adult tickets and 519 children tickets were sold on Friday evening based on the total number of tickets sold and the total amount of money earned.", "prompt_tokens": 124, "completion_tokens": 414, "total_tokens": 538}

Find the amount of each investment if his overall net profit is $ 650 .", "system_text": "None", "response": "Let X be the amount Sam invested in the fund and Y be the amount he invested in stocks.\n\nAccording to the problem, we know that:\n\nX + Y = $10,000    (Equation 1)\n\nThe profit from the fund is 11% of X, which is 0.11X. The loss from stocks is 4% of Y, which is -0.04Y (note the negative sign because it's a loss). \n\nSo the overall net profit is the sum of the profit and loss, which is:\n\n0.11X - 0.04Y = $650   (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find X and Y.\n\nFirst, we can multiply Equation 1 by -0.04 and add it to Equation 2:\n\n-0.04X - 0.04Y + 0.11X - 0.04Y = $650 - (-0.04 x $10,000)\n\n0.07X - 0.08Y = $1,050    (Equation 3)\n\nNext, we can multiply Equation 1 by 0.08 and add it to Equation 3:\n\n0.08X + 0.08Y + 0.07X - 0.08Y = $800\n\n0.15X = $800\n\nX = $5,333.33\n\nNow we can substitute X into Equation 1 to find Y:\n\n$5,333.33 + Y = $10,000\n\nY = $4,666.67\n\nTherefore, Sam invested $5,333.33 in the fund and $4,666.67 in stocks.", "prompt_tokens": 76, "completion_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 433}

The sum of two brothers is 46 . The younger brother is 10 more than a third of the older brothers age . How old is the younger brother ?", "system_text": "None", "response": "Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of the two brothers. Let's call the older brother's age 'x' and the younger brother's age 'y'. \n\nWe are given that the sum of their ages is 46, which we can write as an equation: \n\nx + y = 46 \n\nWe are also given that the younger brother is 10 more than a third of the older brother's age. We can write this as another equation: \n\ny = (1/3)x + 10 \n\nNow we have two equations and two variables, so we can solve for either x or y. Let's solve for x using the first equation: \n\nx + y = 46 \n\nx = 46 - y \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation: \n\ny = (1/3)x + 10 \n\ny = (1/3)(46 - y) + 10 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: \n\n3y = 46 - y + 30 \n\n4y = 76 \n\ny = 19 \n\nSo the younger brother is 19 years old. To check, we can substitute this value into either equation: \n\nx + y = 46 \n\nx + 19 = 46 \n\nx = 27 \n\nSo the older brother is 27 years old. \n\nTherefore, the younger brother is 19 years old.", "prompt_tokens": 55, "completion_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 345}

Lorna is twice as older as peter . if their ages add up to 9 years old , how old is peter", "system_text": "None", "response": "Let's start by setting up equations to represent the given information. Let P be Peter's age and L be Lorna's age:\n\nL = 2P          (Lorna is twice as old as Peter)\n\nP + L = 9         (Their ages add up to 9 years old)\n\nWe can use substitution to solve for Peter's age. First, substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\nP + 2P = 9\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n3P = 9\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we find:\n\nP = 3\n\nTherefore, Peter is 3 years old. To check our work, we can use the first equation to find Lorna's age:\n\nL = 2P\n\nL = 2(3)\n\nL = 6\n\nSo Lorna is 6 years old, and together they add up to 9 years old, as the second equation stated.
