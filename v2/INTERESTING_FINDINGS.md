Since ChatGPT gave us equations in a more consistent format, 
I can now throw the equations into Sympy to do cool stuff with it!

Cool stuff!
-   I solved the system of equations that ChatGPT provided and compared the solve answer to ChatGPT's final answer
    It's pretty promising! Major improvements across all classifiers (except maybe KMeans)
